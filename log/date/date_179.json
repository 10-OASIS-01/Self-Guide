Since Jane is correct, we will consider today's date as 6/18/2019.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago from 6/18/2019. To do this, we will subtract 10 days from the current date.\n\nStep 3: To find the date 10 days ago, we will subtract 10 from the day, which gives us 8. So, the day 10 days ago is 8.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to check if the month needs to be adjusted. Since we are subtracting 10 days from June, we need to see if we need to go back to the previous month.\n\nStep 5: Since June has 30 days, we can subtract 10 days from 18, which brings us to 8. This means we are still in the month of June.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to consider the year. Since we are still in the year 2019, we don't need to make any adjustments to the year.\n\nStep 7: So, the date 10 days ago from 6/18/2019 is 6/8/2019.\n\nNow, based on this analysis, can you determine the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
