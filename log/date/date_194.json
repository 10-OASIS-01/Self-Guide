This means that the current date is ten years after May 6, 1992.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the current year\nTo find the current year, we need to add 10 years to 1992. So, 1992 + 10 = 2002. Therefore, the current year is 2002.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the current month and day\nSince May 6 is the reference point, we need to add 10 years to this date. This means we need to find the date 10 years after May 6, 1992. To do this, we add 10 years to the year and then calculate the new month and day.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new month and day\nTo find the new month and day, we add 10 years to May 6, 1992. This gives us May 6, 2002. Therefore, the current date is May 6, 2002.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer\nSo, the current date in MM/DD/YYYY format is 05/06/2002.\n\nBy following these steps, you can calculate the current date based on the given information."
