So, we need to figure out what the date is tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nTo do this, we need to start by looking at the current date, which is 12/31/1929. Since tomorrow is the next day, we need to add 1 to the day. However, since December only has 31 days, adding 1 to 31 would give us 32, which is not a valid day in December.\n\nSo, we need to consider the month and year as well. Since we are in December, the next month is January. Therefore, when we add 1 to the day, we also need to change the month to January. \n\nNow, when we change the month to January, we also need to consider the year. If tomorrow is in January, we need to change the year to 1930.\n\nSo, to summarize, to find the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to add 1 to the day, change the month to January, and change the year to 1930.\n\nI hope this analysis helps you understand how to approach this problem. Now, can you use this information to figure out the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
