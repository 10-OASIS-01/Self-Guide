However, 2000 was a leap year, so February had 29 days.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Jane's current age\nIf today is her 16th birthday, we need to calculate how many years have passed since 2000. Since 2000 was a leap year, we need to account for the extra day in February.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the current date\nNow that we know Jane's birthday and her current age, we can calculate the current date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can guide the students to solve the problem correctly and understand the reasoning behind the solution."
