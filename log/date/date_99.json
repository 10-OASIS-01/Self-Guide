This means we need to determine the date that was one day before today's date.\n\nStep 2: Determine today's date\nSince the question states that 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we need to determine today's date. To do this, we can subtract 36 hours from the current date and time to find out what the date was 36 hours ago.\n\nStep 3: Convert hours to days\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we need to convert 36 hours to days. This can be done by dividing 36 by 24, which equals 1.5 days. \n\nStep 4: Subtract 1.5 days from today's date\nNow that we know 36 hours is equivalent to 1.5 days, we can subtract 1.5 days from today's date to find out what the date was yesterday.\n\nStep 5: Determine yesterday's date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nAfter subtracting 1.5 days from today's date, we can express the result in MM/DD/YYYY format to find out the date that was yesterday.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the date that was yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format."
