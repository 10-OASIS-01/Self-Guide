Let's say today's date is 01/21/2012.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the date one year ago from today\nTo find the date one year ago from today, we need to subtract 1 year from the current year. So, 2012 - 1 = 2011. This gives us the year.\n\nStep 3: Determine the month and day\nSince today's date is 01/21/2012, we need to subtract 1 year from the month and day as well. So, the month and day one year ago from today would be the same as today's month and day, which is 01/21.\n\nSo, the date one year ago from today is 01/21/2011.\n\nNow, can you use this step-by-step analysis to determine the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
