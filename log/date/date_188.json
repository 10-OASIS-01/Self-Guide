Since John is correct and today is 6/19/2019, we can confirm that as the current date.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the date 10 days ago. To do this, we will subtract 10 days from the current date (6/19/2019).\n\nStep 3: To find the date 10 days ago, we will subtract 10 days from the day (19) in the current date. This will give us 9.\n\nStep 4: Since we are subtracting 10 days, we need to account for the previous month if necessary. In this case, since we are subtracting 10 days from June 19th, we will still be in the month of June.\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to determine the new day. Since we subtracted 10 days from the 19th, the new day will be 9.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to write the new date in MM/DD/YYYY format. So, the date 10 days ago from 6/19/2019 is 6/9/2019.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to find the date 10 days ago. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
