This means that the current date is ten years after May 6, 1992.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the current date\nTo find the current date, we need to add ten years to May 6, 1992. This means we need to add 10 years to the year 1992, which gives us the year 2002.\n\nStep 3: Determine the date yesterday\nNow that we know the current year is 2002, we need to find the date that was yesterday. To do this, we need to subtract one day from May 6, 2002.\n\nStep 4: Consider the number of days in each month\nWe need to be mindful of the number of days in each month. May has 31 days, so if we subtract one day from May 6, 2002, we get May 5, 2002.\n\nStep 5: Write the date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nThe date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 05/05/2002.\n\nNow, based on the analysis provided, can you determine the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
