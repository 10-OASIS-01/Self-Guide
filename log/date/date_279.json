Today's date is MM/DD/YYYY, and we need to find the date one week ago from today.\n\nStep 2: To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date.\n\nStep 3: Let's start by looking at the month. If today is December, and we subtract 7 days, we need to make sure we don't go into the previous month. December has 31 days, so if we subtract 7 days from the 31st, we should still be in December.\n\nStep 4: Now let's look at the day. If today is the 31st, and we subtract 7 days, we get 24. So, one week ago from today would be December 24th.\n\nStep 5: Finally, let's look at the year. We started with 1929, and we are still in the same year, so the year remains the same.\n\nSo, the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/24/1929."
