A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. In this case, the date 02/02/2020 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards in the MMDDYYYY format.\n\nNow, we need to find the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format. \n\nTo do this, we need to start with today's date, which is 02/02/2020. \n\nTo find yesterday's date, we need to subtract 1 from the day. So, yesterday's date would be 02/01/2020. \n\nSo, the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/01/2020. \n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to approach this problem.
