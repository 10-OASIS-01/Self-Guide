So, if we subtract one month from March, we will be in February. \n\nFebruary has 28 days in a common year, and 29 days in a leap year. \n\nSince 1966 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the date a month ago by subtracting 28 days from the current date. \n\nI will let you take it from here and calculate the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format.
