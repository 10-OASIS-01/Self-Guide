Since John is correct in thinking today is 6/19/2019, we will use that as our starting point.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the date one week from today. To do this, we need to add 7 days to the current date.\n\nStep 3: Start by adding 7 days to the day of the month. In this case, 19 + 7 = 26. So, the day of the month for the new date will be 26.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to consider the month. Since we are adding 7 days to June, we need to check if the new date falls within June or if it spills over into July.\n\nStep 5: Counting 7 days from June 19th takes us to June 26th, so the new date is still within the same month.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to consider the year. Since we are still in 2019, the year for the new date will remain the same.\n\nStep 7: Now that we have considered the day, month, and year, we can put it all together to find the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the correct date one week from today."
