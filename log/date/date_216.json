Today is 02022020, which is the same forwards and backwards, making it a palindrome date.\n\nNow, we need to find the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format. To do this, we need to subtract one month from today's date.\n\nOne way to approach this is to start by subtracting one month from the current month. So, if today is February 2, 2020, then one month ago would be January 2, 2020. \n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of the month having 30 or 31 days, as well as the leap year. So, we need to take into account the specific number of days in each month and the leap year status.\n\nLet's take a moment to consider the number of days in January and February, as well as the leap year status, and then we can continue from there."
