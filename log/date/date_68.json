So, we need to calculate the current date.\n\nStep 2: Since February is the only month with less than 30 days, we need to consider if it's a leap year. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be evenly divisible by 400. So, we need to determine if 2001 is a leap year.\n\nStep 3: If 2001 is not a leap year, then the last day of February would be February 28th. So, we need to calculate the current date based on that information.\n\nStep 4: Once we have the current date, we can then calculate one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in solving the problem. Let me know if you need further guidance on any of the steps."
