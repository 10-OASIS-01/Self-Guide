In this case, the current date is the last day of January 2012.\n\nStep 2: Subtract one year from the current date\nTo subtract one year from the current date, we need to subtract 1 from the year. So, the current year is 2012, and when we subtract 1 from it, we get 2011.\n\nStep 3: Determine the date one year ago\nNow that we have the year (2011), we can keep the month and day the same as the current date.
