Since the current month is August (8), subtracting 1 from 8 gives us 7.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of days in the previous month\nNow that we have the previous month (7), we need to determine how many days are in July. July has 31 days.\n\nStep 5: Determine the day in the previous month\nSince the current date is 3, and July has 31 days, we need to subtract 3 from 31 to find the day in the previous month.\n\nStep 6: Determine the year\nThe year remains the same, so the year for the date a month ago is 1997.\n\nStep 7: Put it all together\nNow that we have the month (7), the day (28), and the year (1997), we can put it all together to find the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in finding the date a month ago.
