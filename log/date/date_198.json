This gives us the year 2002.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the date a month ago\n- To find the date that was a month ago from the present time (2002), we need to subtract one month from the present date. \n- Start by determining the current month and day. Then, subtract one month from the current month. If the current month is January, then the previous month would be December of the previous year.\n\nStep 4: Determine the final date\n- Once you have the previous month and year, determine the number of days in that month and calculate the date that was a month ago.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the date that was a month ago from the present time."
