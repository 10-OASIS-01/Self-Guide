Since we are subtracting 1 day from the month of July, we need to check if the previous month has 30 or 31 days.\nStep 5: The previous month, June, has 30 days. So, when we subtract 1 day from Jul 1, we get Jun 30.\nStep 6: Finally, we need to consider the year. Since we are subtracting 1 day from the year 2002, we need to check if the previous year is a leap year or not.\nStep 7: The previous year, 2001, is not a leap year.
