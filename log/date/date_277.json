To do this, we need to subtract one month from the given date. \n\nSo, if we subtract one month from December 31, 1929, we would go back to November 31, 1929. However, November only has 30 days, so November 31st is not a valid date. \n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the date to the last day of November, which is November 30, 1929. \n\nSo, the date a month ago from 12/31/1929 is 11/30/1929. \n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to approach this type of problem. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
