Since the concert was delayed by one day to today, the date is 06/02/1943.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the date one year ago from today. To do this, we subtract one year from the current year, which gives us 1942.\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to consider if the date one year ago falls within a leap year. A leap year occurs every 4 years, so we need to check if 1942 was a leap year.\n\nStep 4: If 1942 was a leap year, then the date one year ago from today would be 06/02/1942.
