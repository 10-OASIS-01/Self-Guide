The analysis correctly identifies today's date, subtracts 10 days, and considers the leap year aspect. \n\nRefined reasoning process:\n1. Today's date is 02/02/2020.\n2. Subtracting 10 days from 02/02/2020 gives us 01/23/2020.\n3. Considering the leap year, February has 29 days in 2020, so subtracting 10 days does not change the month.\n4. Therefore, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/23/2020.\n\nAnswer:\n01/23/2020"
