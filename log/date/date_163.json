Today's date is 3/5/YYYY, and we want to find the date one year ago from today. \n\nTo do this, we need to subtract 1 year from the year 1973. So, the year one year ago from 1973 is 1972.\n\nNext, we need to find the date one year ago from today in 1972. Since Jane saw the meteor shower for the second time in 1973, we can assume that she saw it for the first time in 1972. \n\nSo, the date one year ago from today in 1972 would be 3/5/1972.\n\nNow, we have the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.
