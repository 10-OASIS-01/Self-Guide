This means that she has already seen a meteor shower once this year. \n\nSo, we need to figure out the date of the first meteor shower Jane saw in 1973. To do this, we need to count back from today's date. Since today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time seeing a meteor shower, we can count back to the first meteor shower she saw. \n\nOnce we have the date of the first meteor shower, we can then determine the date of yesterday by subtracting 1 from the day of the first meteor shower.\n\nI hope this helps you start to think about how to solve the problem. Let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance."
