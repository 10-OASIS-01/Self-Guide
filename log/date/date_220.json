The palindrome day of 2020 is February 2, 2020, which can be written as 02/02/2020.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format. To do this, we need to add 24 hours to the current date and time. \n\nStep 3: Let's start by adding 24 hours to the time. Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours to the current time will bring us to the same time on the following day.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to consider the date. Since February only has 28 days in 2020, adding 24 hours to February 2nd will bring us to February 3rd.\n\nStep 5: So, the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/03/2020.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to find the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
