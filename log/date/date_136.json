To do this, we need to subtract 1 month from the current date, March 12, 2002.\n\nStep 4: To find the date a month ago, we need to consider the varying number of days in each month. Some months have 30 days, while others have 31 days. February has 28 days, except in a leap year when it has 29 days.\n\nStep 5: Let's determine the date a month ago by subtracting 1 month from March 12, 2002. We need to consider the specific number of days in February and the number of days in the previous month, which was February.\n\nStep 6: After considering the varying number of days in each month, we can determine the date a month ago from today.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately calculate the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format."
