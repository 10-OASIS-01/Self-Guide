Since Jane is correct, today's date is 6/18/2019.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the date a month ago. To do this, we need to subtract one month from the current date. \n\nStep 3: Since the current month is June, and we want to go back one month, we need to subtract 1 from the month. This gives us 5.\n\nStep 4: However, we also need to consider the number of days in May. May has 31 days, so if we subtract one month from June 18th, we get May 18th.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 05/18/2019.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to calculate the date a month ago.
