The date given is 12/31/1929, which means it is December 31st, 1929.\n\nStep 2: The question asks for the date 24 hours later. So, we need to add 24 hours to the given date to find the new date.\n\nStep 3: Let's consider the different components of the date - the month, the day, and the year. Since we are adding 24 hours, we need to consider the possibility of the day and month changing.\n\nStep 4: Adding 24 hours to the given date means we are adding 1 day to the date. So, we need to consider what happens when we add 1 day to December 31st, 1929.\n\nStep 5: December has 31 days, so adding 1 day to December 31st, 1929, would take us to January 1st, 1930. However, we also need to consider the year component. Adding 1 day to December 31st, 1929, would indeed change the year to 1930.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the date 24 hours later than 12/31/1929 in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/01/1930.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the correct date 24 hours later from the given date."
