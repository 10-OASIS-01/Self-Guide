To do this, we need to add 24 hours to the given date.\n\nStep 3: Since there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours to the given date will result in the next day's date.\n\nStep 4: To find the date 24 hours later, we can simply add 1 to the day part of the given date. So, the day part of the date 24 hours later will be 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nStep 5: However, we also need to consider the month and year. If adding 1 to the day part results in a date that is greater than the number of days in the month, we need to adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\nStep 6: In this case, since the given date is 8/3/1997, adding 1 to the day part results in 9, which is less than 31 (the maximum number of days in August). Therefore, the month and year remain the same.\n\nStep 7: So, the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY format is 8/4/1997.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to find the date 24 hours later. Now, can you try to solve the problem on your own? If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask."
