Since today is the second day of the third month of 1966, we can start by subtracting 1 from the current date to find the date of yesterday.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the number of days in each month. In general, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and so on.\n\nSo, if today is the second day of the third month, then yesterday would be the first day of the third month.\n\nNow, we need to consider if 1966 is a leap year. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be evenly divisible by 400. In this case, 1966 is not evenly divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year. Therefore, February has 28 days.\n\nSo, if today is the second day of the third month, then yesterday would be the first day of the third month, which we can express as 03/01/1966.\n\nI hope this helps guide you through the problem! Let me know if you have any further questions."
