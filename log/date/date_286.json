Since the day before yesterday was 11/23/1933, yesterday would be 11/24/1933.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's figure out what the date was a month ago from 11/24/1933. To do this, we need to subtract one month from the date. Since November has 30 days, we can simply subtract 30 days from 11/24/1933.\n\nStep 3: After subtracting 30 days from 11/24/1933, we get 10/25/1933. So, the date a month ago from 11/24/1933 is 10/25/1933.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to solve the problem.
