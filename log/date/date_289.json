To do this, we can simply add 7 days to the current date of 11/25/1933. \n\nTo find the date one week from today, we can start by adding 7 days to the current day, which would be 11/32/1933. However, November only has 30 days, so we need to carry over to the next month. \n\nSo, we subtract 30 from 32, which gives us 2.
