In the US, the time changes from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time on the first Sunday in November. In 2001, this occurred on November 4th. This means that we need to account for the time change when adding 24 hours to the date of Thanksgiving.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new date\nTaking into account the time change, we can now calculate the new date that is 24 hours later than Thanksgiving in 2001.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to approach the problem. Now, can you try to calculate the date 24 hours later from Thanksgiving in 2001? If you get stuck, feel free to ask for further guidance."
