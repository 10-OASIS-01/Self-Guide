            "content": "Step 1: First, let's figure out how many days the 40 eggs lasted for Jane. She bought the eggs on May 9th, 2017 and ate one per day. So, the eggs lasted for 40 days.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find out the date 10 days ago from today. Today's date is [current date]. To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from the current date.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can start by subtracting 10 days from the day part of the current date. Then, if the result is less than 1, we need to go back to the previous month and find out how many days are there in that month. We will then subtract the remaining days from the total days in that month and continue this process until we have subtracted 10 days.\n\nStep 4: Once we have the day part of the date, we can move on to the month part of the current date. If we need to go back to the previous month, we will subtract 1 from the month part of the current date and continue this process until we have subtracted 10 days.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we will have the date 10 days ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in solving the problem. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
