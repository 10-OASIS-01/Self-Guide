Since she was born on the last day of February in 2001, we can calculate her birthday by adding 16 years to her birth year. This gives us February 28, 2017.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the date a month ago\nTo find the date a month ago, we need to subtract 1 month from the current date. Since February is a special case with fewer days, we need to consider this when subtracting a month.\n\nStep 3: Consider the number of days in the previous month\nSince February is the previous month, we need to consider that it has 28 days in a non-leap year. Therefore, if we subtract a month from February 28, we will end up in January.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the date a month ago\nBy subtracting a month from February 28, we end up in January. Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/28/2017.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to approach this problem. Now, can you try to solve it on your own? Let me know if you need any further guidance."
