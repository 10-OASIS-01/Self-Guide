Since she was born on the last day of February in 2000, her birthday would be on February 29th, 2016 (since 2000 was a leap year).\n\nStep 2: Calculate yesterday's date\nTo find yesterday's date, we need to subtract 1 day from Jane's birthday. Since February 2016 has 29 days, we need to subtract 1 from 29 to get yesterday's date.\n\nStep 3: Consider the month and year\nAfter subtracting 1 from 29, we get 28.
