This brings us to March 11, 2002.\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to continue subtracting the remaining 9 days from March 11, 2002 to find the date 10 days ago.\n\nStep 5: After subtracting the remaining 9 days, we arrive at February 30, 2002. However, February only has 28 or 29 days, so February 30 does not exist.\n\nStep 6: To find the correct date, we need to adjust for the extra days beyond February. Since February is the shortest month, we need to subtract the extra days from February and move back to January.\n\nStep 7: After adjusting for the extra days, we find that the date 10 days ago is February 28, 2002.\n\nSo, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02/28/2002."
