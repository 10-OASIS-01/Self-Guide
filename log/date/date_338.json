So, she would have run out of eggs 40 days after May 9th, 2017.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's find out the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017. We can do this by adding 40 days to May 9th, 2017.\n\nStep 3: To find the date 40 days after May 9th, 2017, we can start by adding 30 days to May 9th, 2017, which brings us to June 8th, 2017. This leaves us with 10 more days to add.\n\nStep 4: Adding 10 more days to June 8th, 2017, brings us to June 18th, 2017.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's find the date one year ago from today. Today's date is [current date]. So, we need to subtract one year from today's date to find the date one year ago.\n\nStep 6: After subtracting one year from today's date, we arrive at the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in solving the problem. Now, can you try to find the date one year ago from today? If you have any questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask."
