So, if today is MM/DD/YYYY, then the date three years ago would be MM/DD/2016.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's calculate the date two days after Jane's start date. Her second day at work was on Dec 2, 2016. So, if we add two days to that date, we can find the date when she spilled coffee on her laptop.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the date two days after Dec 2, 2016. This would give us the date when Jane spilled coffee on her laptop.\n\nStep 5: Finally, to find the date yesterday, we need to subtract one day from the date when Jane spilled coffee on her laptop.\n\nBy following these steps, you can guide the students to calculate the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format."
