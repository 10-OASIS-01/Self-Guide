We know that today is 3/5, and it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. So, we need to figure out when the first meteor shower was. \n\nTo do this, we need to count 10 days back from today's date. So, we start with 3/5 and subtract 10 days. \n\nNext, we need to consider the fact that it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower. This means that the first meteor shower must have occurred before today's date. \n\nSo, we need to go back to the first meteor shower and then count 10 days back from that date to find the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this breakdown helps you understand the steps needed to solve the problem. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
