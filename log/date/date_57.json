Since we know she was born on the last day of February in 2000, we can calculate her birthday by adding 16 years to her birth year. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the current date\nBy adding 16 years to 2000, we get 2016. So, Jane's 16th birthday is on February 29, 2016. However, 2016 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. \n\nStep 3: Calculate the date a month ago\nTo find the date a month ago, we need to subtract 1 month from February 29, 2016. Since February only has 28 days in non-leap years, we need to consider this when calculating the date a month ago.\n\nStep 4: Consider the number of days in the previous month\nSince February only has 28 days in non-leap years, the previous month (January) will have 31 days. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract 28 days from February 29, 2016, which will take us to January 31, 2016.\n\nSo, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/31/2016."
