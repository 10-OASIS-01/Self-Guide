However, we also need to consider the number of days in each month and whether the year is a leap year.\n\nStep 4: Start by adding 24 hours to the current date. This will take us to Wed, 7/10/1972.\n\nStep 5: Since we have reached the next day, we need to check if the date is still within the same month or if it has rolled over to the next month.\n\nStep 6: In this case, the date is still within the same month, so we don't need to change the month.\n\nStep 7: Now, we need to check if the year is a leap year. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be evenly divisible by 400. In this case, 1972 is evenly divisible by 4, so it is a leap year.\n\nStep 8: Since it is a leap year, we don't need to make any adjustments to the date.\n\nStep 9: Now that we have added 24 hours to the current date and considered the month and leap year, we have the date 24 hours later from Tue, 7/9/1972.\n\nStep 10: Guide the students to provide the final answer in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, the students should be able to correctly determine the date 24 hours later from the given date."
