The current local time is 3:02 pm of 5/4/2004.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to calculate the date that was a month ago from the current date. To do this, we need to subtract one month from the current date.\n\nStep 3: To subtract one month from the current date, we need to consider the number of days in each month. We can start by subtracting 1 month from the month of May (5). This would give us the month of April (4).\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to consider the day of the month. Since April does not have 31 days, we need to adjust the day accordingly. We need to consider the current day (4) and subtract the number of days in April (30). \n\nStep 5: After adjusting the day, we also need to consider the year. Since we are only subtracting one month, the year remains the same.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to format the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in figuring out the date that was a month ago from the current date.
