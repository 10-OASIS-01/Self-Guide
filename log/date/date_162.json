Since the current date is 3/5, we need to go back to the previous month, which is February.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of days in the previous month\nFebruary has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year. Since 1973 is not a leap year, February has 28 days.\n\nStep 5: Subtract the current day from the number of days in the previous month\nTo find the date a month ago, we subtract the current day (5) from the number of days in the previous month (28).\n\nStep 6: Calculate the date a month ago\nBy subtracting 5 from 28, we get 23. Therefore, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 2/23/1973.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to calculate the date a month ago.
