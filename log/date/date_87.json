To find the exact date, we need to add 3 years to the year she got her job, which is 2016. So, 2016 + 3 = 2019. Therefore, Jane's 3-year work anniversary is in 2019.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's determine the exact date of Jane's second day at work. We know that she spilled coffee on her laptop on Dec 2, which means her first day at work was on Dec 1. \n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the date 24 hours later from Dec 2. To do this, we simply add 24 hours to the time of the spill. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
