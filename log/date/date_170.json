To do this, we need to subtract 10 days from Jan 21, 2011.\n\nTo do this, we can start by subtracting 1 day at a time. So, if we subtract 1 day from Jan 21, 2011, we get Jan 20, 2011. Then, if we subtract another day, we get Jan 19, 2011. We can continue this process until we have subtracted 10 days in total.\n\nSo, let's start by subtracting 1 day at a time and see where we end up.\n\nDoes that make sense so far?"
