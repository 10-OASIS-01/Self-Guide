Since the first Monday of 2019 is January 7th, we can count the number of days from January 7th to January 1st. This gives us 6 days. Since 6 is evenly divisible by 7, the first day of 2019 is also a Tuesday.\n\nStep 2: Determine the day of the week for today\nSince today is the first Monday of 2019, we already know that today is Monday.\n\nStep 3: Determine the day of the week for tomorrow\nSince today is Monday, tomorrow will be Tuesday.\n\nStep 4: Determine the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format\nSince tomorrow is Tuesday, we need to determine the date that corresponds to the first Tuesday of 2019. To do this, we can count the number of days from the first Tuesday of 2019 (January 1st) to the first Monday of 2019 (January 7th). This gives us 6 days.
