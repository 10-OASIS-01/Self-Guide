However, we need to be careful about the month and year as well. \n\nStep 4: Check if the month changes\nWhen adding 7 days to the current date, we need to check if the month changes. In this case, adding 7 days to January 2nd, 1987, will result in January 9th, 1987. Since the month does not change, the date one week from today is still in January.\n\nStep 5: Check if the year changes\nAdding 7 days to January 2nd, 1987, does not change the year, so the date one week from today is still in 1987.\n\nStep 6: Convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format\nNow that we have determined the date one week from today (January 9th, 1987), we need to convert it to the MM/DD/YYYY format. \n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to calculate the date one week from today in the MM/DD/YYYY format. Now, can you determine the final date in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
