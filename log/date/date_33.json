If it is, then the new date is simply the new day and the current month and year. If the new day is greater than the number of days in the month, we need to adjust the month and the day accordingly.\n\nStep 5: Once we have the new day and month, we can simply write the date in the MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the date one week from today.
