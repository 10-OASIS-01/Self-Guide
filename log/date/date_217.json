Today is 02022020, which is the same forwards and backwards, making it a palindrome date.\n\nNext, we need to find the date one year ago from today. To do this, we need to subtract 1 year from the current year (2020) and keep the month and day the same.\n\nSo, if we subtract 1 year from 2020, we get 2019. Therefore, the year one year ago from today is 2019.\n\nNow, we need to keep the month and day the same as today's date (0202) and change the year to 2019. So, the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 02022019.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to find the date one year ago from today. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
