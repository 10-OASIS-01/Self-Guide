Today is 3/5, so we need to add 7 days to this date. \n\nTo do this, we can start by adding 7 days to the day of the month. 5 + 7 = 12. So, one week from today, the day of the month will be 12.\n\nNext, we need to consider the month. Since today is 3/5, adding 7 days will take us into the next month. So, we need to determine how many days are in March and then figure out how many days are left in March after adding 7 days.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the year. Since the year is 1973, we don't need to make any changes to the year.\n\nSo, let's start by determining the number of days in March. March has 31 days, so if we add 7 days to the 5th, we will have 26 days left in March after one week.\n\nNow, let's put it all together to determine the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY format."
