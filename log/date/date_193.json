John believes that today is 6/19/2019, and we are going to assume that he is correct.\n\nStep 2: Determine the date 24 hours later\nTo find the date 24 hours later, we need to add 24 hours to the current date. However, we need to be careful when adding hours to the date, as it may result in a change of the day, month, or year.\n\nStep 3: Add 24 hours to the current date\nTo add 24 hours to the current date, we need to consider the current time. If the current time is before midnight, adding 24 hours will result in the next day. If the current time is after midnight, adding 24 hours will result in the day after the next day.\n\nStep 4: Consider the time of day\nSince we don't have information about the current time, we need to consider both possibilities. If the current time is before midnight, adding 24 hours will result in the next day. If the current time is after midnight, adding 24 hours will result in the day after the next day.\n\nStep 5: Determine the date 24 hours later\nBased on the previous steps, we can now determine the date 24 hours later. We need to consider the current time and whether it is before or after midnight to accurately calculate the date 24 hours later.\n\nBy following these steps, we can guide the students to think critically about the problem and arrive at the correct solution."
