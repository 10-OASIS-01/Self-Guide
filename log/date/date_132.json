We need to figure out what the correct date is today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nStep 2: Determine the original date\nSince Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, we start with this date.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the correct date\nWe know that the correct date is 1 day later than what Jane thought. So, we need to add 1 day to the original date to get the correct date.\n\nStep 4: Consider the month and year\nWhen adding 1 day to the original date, we need to consider the month and year. If the original date is the last day of the month, we need to account for the change in month. Similarly, if the original date is December 31st, we need to account for the change in year.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nUsing the information from the previous steps, calculate the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the correct date today in MM/DD/YYYY format."
