This gives us -5. Since there are only 31 days in January, we need to borrow from the month. So, we subtract 1 from the month, making it 01, and add 26 to the day, making it 26.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new month.\nSince we borrowed from the month, the new month is January, which is 01.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the new year.\nThe year remains the same, which is 2020.\n\nStep 6: Put the new date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\nThe date one week ago from today is 01/26/2020.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to calculate the date one week ago from today.
