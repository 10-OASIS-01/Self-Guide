So, her visits would be on October 16, 2009, November 16, 2009, December 16, 2009, and so on.\n\nStep 2: Since it is her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we need to figure out which month and year she is currently in. To do this, we can count her visits: October 2009, November 2009, December 2009, January 2010, and February 2010. So, her 5th visit is in February 2010.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find out the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format. To do this, we can simply add 1 to the current date. So, if today is February 16, 2010, then tomorrow would be February 17, 2010.\n\nI hope this analysis helps you understand how to approach the problem. Now, can you figure out the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY format based on the analysis we just did?"
