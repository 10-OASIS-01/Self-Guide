This means we need to subtract 2003 from 2002. However, since we are looking for the date one year ago from today, we also need to consider the specific date (July 29) and take into account any potential changes in the number of days in each month.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the date one year ago\nTo calculate the date one year ago, we need to subtract 1 year from 2003, which gives us 2002. Since we are looking for the date one year ago from July 29, we need to consider the fact that July has 31 days. Therefore, the date one year ago from today would be July 29, 2002.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, what is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?"
