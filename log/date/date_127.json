Since she visits on the 16th of each month, we can calculate the date of her 5th visit by adding 16 days to each month for a total of 4 months.\n\nStep 2: Starting from October 2009, let's add 16 days for each month until we reach her 5th visit. This will take us to February 2010.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's calculate the date of her 5th visit. Since February only has 28 days, we need to account for this. Let's add 16 days to February 2010, which will take us to March 4th, 2010.\n\nStep 4: Finally, let's calculate the date a month ago from March 4th, 2010. We can do this by subtracting 1 month from March 4th, which will take us to February 4th, 2010.\n\nSo, the date a month ago from today's date is February 4th, 2010."
