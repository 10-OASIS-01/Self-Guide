We know that there are 7 days in a week, so if the first day of the year is a Tuesday, we can count the days to find out the day of the week for any other date in 2019.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of days between the first day of the year and the first Monday of the year\nSince today is the first Monday of 2019, we need to count the number of days from the first day of the year (Tuesday) to the first Monday of the year. This will give us the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year.\n\nStep 3: Use the number of days to determine the date\nOnce we have the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year, we can use this information to determine the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the date today based on the given information."
