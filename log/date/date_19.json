Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that yesterday's date means we need to subtract one day from the given date, which is 11/12/2019.\n\nTo do this, we need to start with the day, which is 12. Since yesterday is one day before today, we subtract 1 from 12, which gives us 11.\n\nNext, we move on to the month, which is 11. Since yesterday is still within the same month, we don't need to make any changes to the month.\n\nFinally, we look at the year, which is 2019.
