Since today is the first Monday of 2019, yesterday would have been the first Sunday of 2019.\n\nTo find the date, we can count backwards from the first Monday:\n- Sunday (1 day before Monday)\n\nSo, the date yesterday would be the first Sunday of 2019.\n\nNow, can you use this information to figure out the date in MM/DD/YYYY format?"
