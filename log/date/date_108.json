To do this, we need to subtract 10 days from the given date.\n\nStep 3: Start by subtracting 10 days from the day part of the date. In this case, the day part is 02. So, 02 - 10 = -8.\n\nStep 4: Since we can't have a negative day, we need to borrow days from the month. In this case, we need to borrow 8 days from January, which means we need to go back to December.\n\nStep 5: December has 31 days, so we can borrow 8 days from December. This means the new day part of the date will be 23.\n\nStep 6: The month part of the date remains the same, which is 01.\n\nStep 7: The year part of the date remains the same, which is 1987.\n\nStep 8: So, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/23/1987.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to find the date 10 days ago in the given format. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
