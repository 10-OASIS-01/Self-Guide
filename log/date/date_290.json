To find the date 24 hours later, we need to first determine the date that was two days ago from 11/23/1933.\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 days from 11/23/1933\nTo find the date two days ago, we need to subtract 2 days from 11/23/1933. \n\nStep 3: Calculate the date two days ago\nBy subtracting 2 days from 11/23/1933, we get 11/21/1933. This is the date that was two days ago from 11/23/1933.\n\nStep 4: Add 24 hours to 11/21/1933\nNow that we have determined the date two days ago, we need to add 24 hours to find the date 24 hours later.\n\nStep 5: Convert 24 hours to days\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, adding 24 hours is equivalent to adding 1 day to the date 11/21/1933.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the date 24 hours later\nBy adding 1 day to 11/21/1933, we get the date 11/22/1933.
