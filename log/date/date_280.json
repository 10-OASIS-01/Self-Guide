To do this, we need to add 7 days to today's date. \n\nStep 3: Start by adding 7 days to the day of the month (31). This would give us 38, but since December only has 31 days, we need to subtract 31 from 38, leaving us with 7.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to determine the new month. Since we are adding 7 days to December 31st, we will move into the next month, which is January.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we need to determine the new year. Since we are adding 7 days to December 31st, we will move into the next year, which is 1930.\n\nStep 6: Now that we have determined the new day, month, and year, we can put it all together to find the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you understand how to solve the problem.
