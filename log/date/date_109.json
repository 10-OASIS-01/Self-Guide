So, today's date is 02/01/1987, which means it is the 2nd of January, 1987.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the date a month ago\nTo calculate the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from the current date. Since January has 31 days, if we subtract one month from the 2nd of January, we will end up in December.\n\nStep 3: Subtract one month from the current date\nTo subtract one month from the current date, we need to subtract 1 from the month. So, 01 (January) - 1 = 00. However, since there is no month 00, we need to borrow a month from the year.\n\nStep 4: Borrow a month from the year\nWhen we borrow a month from the year, we need to subtract 1 from the year and set the month to 12 (December). So, 1987 - 1 = 1986 and the month becomes 12.\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of days in the previous month\nSince December has 31 days, we need to determine the correct day for the date a month ago.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the date a month ago\nThe date a month ago would be 12/02/1986, which means it is the 2nd of December, 1986.\n\nSo, the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/02/1986."
