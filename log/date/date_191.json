To do this, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date.\n\nStep 3: Start by subtracting 7 days from the day part of the date. So, 19 - 7 = 12.\n\nStep 4: Next, let's consider the month part of the date. Since we are subtracting 7 days, we need to check if we need to go back to the previous month. In this case, since the current month is June, we don't need to go back to the previous month.\n\nStep 5: Finally, let's consider the year part of the date. Since we are still in the same year, 2019, we don't need to make any changes to the year.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's put all the parts together to get the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nI hope this step-by-step analysis helps you in solving the problem. Can you try to calculate the date one week ago from today using the steps we discussed?"
