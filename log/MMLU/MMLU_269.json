She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n—Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nWhich of the following would be most likely to support the perspective expressed by Riis in the passage above?",

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

            "content": "First, let's analyze the perspective expressed by Riis in the passage. Riis is highlighting the difficult living and working conditions of a young woman in the manufacturing department, who is barely able to afford basic necessities like food and is trapped in a cycle of poverty. He also mentions the pride of American-born girls preventing them from seeking certain types of help, even in the face of extreme poverty.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\nA: A supporter of Social Darwinism - Social Darwinism was a belief that only the fittest individuals and societies would survive and succeed. This perspective would not support the idea of helping individuals in poverty, as it goes against the idea of natural selection and survival of the fittest.\n\nB: A Progressive - Progressives were social and political reformers who aimed to address social issues such as poverty and working conditions. This perspective would be most likely to support Riis's perspective, as it aligns with the idea of addressing the hardships faced by the working class.\n\nC: A businessman - While some businessmen may support social reform, it is not a given that they would support the perspective expressed by Riis. Their support would depend on their individual beliefs and values.\n\nD: An opponent of immigration - This perspective is focused on immigration and would not necessarily align with the issues raised by Riis regarding the working and living conditions of the American-born girl in the passage.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely supporter of the perspective expressed by Riis in the passage would be a Progressive. This is because Progressives were known for advocating for social and political reform to address issues such as poverty and working conditions, which aligns with the concerns raised by Riis in the passage."
