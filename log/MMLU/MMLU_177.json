Each person names two other people and claims that of the two, exactly one of them is lying. Each person is named in this way by exactly two other people. Find the sum of all possible values of T.\n            {'A': '30', 'B': '12', 'C': '20', 'D': '6'}\n            please provide a detailed analysis.\n            Note: Since your responsibility is to guide students in answering the question,\n            your analysis should think step by step, Please note that your role is to guide them step by step through the problem, so please don't give them the final result\n            Here's a possible example:\n            Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n            First, we need to understand the process of speciation.\n            Speciation occurs when a single population becomes two or more reproductively isolated populations, meaning they can no longer interbreed.\n            Over time, these isolated populations can accumulate genetic differences, leading to the formation of new species.\n            In this scenario, the gradual drop in the water level of the large lake divided the single population of fish into three smaller, isolated populations.\n            After many generations, it was determined that the three populations of fish had become three separate species.\n            Now, let's consider the options provided:\n            A. There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

And each person is named in this way by exactly two others.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these claims. If a person always tells the truth, then the two people they name must include one truth-teller and one liar. Conversely, if a person always lies, then the two people they name must also include one truth-teller and one liar.\n\nGiven that each person is named by exactly two others, we can construct a system of equations to represent this situation. Let's use T to represent the number of truth-tellers and L to represent the number of liars.\n\nWe have the following equations:\nT + L = 11 (since there are 11 people in total)\nT = 2L (since each truth-teller is named by two liars)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations to find the possible values of T. By substituting T = 2L into the first equation, we get:\n2L + L = 11\n3L = 11\nL = 11/3 (which is not a valid solution since the number of people must be a whole number)\n\nSo, it seems that there is a problem with the given information.

We are given that T + L = 11, since there are 11 people in total.\n\nNow, let's consider the claims made by each person. Since each person is named by exactly two others, we can create a system of equations based on the claims. For example, if person A names person B and person C, then one of them is lying. This can be represented as:\nTB + TC = 1 (if B is lying, C is telling the truth, and vice versa)\n\nWe can create similar equations for each person in the group.
