    "question": "A sportsman was the owner of an old dilapidated stadium, which was located on the outskirts of the city. The stadium, which was built in 1932, had been the home stadium for the local professional baseball team for 30 years. However, in 1962, the baseball team franchise moved to another city. Since 1962, the stadium was left unattended and had deteriorated to such an extent that the walls were in danger of collapsing. Last month, an earthquake struck the city. The earthquake, which registered 6. 9 on the Richter scale, caused considerable damage in the city and caused the stadium to collapse. As the stadium crumbled to the ground, a large section of the press box fell on top of a car that was parked nearby. The auto was crushed, causing its gas tank to rupture. As a result, a large quantity of gasoline spilled along the street and flowed downhill. The gasoline collected in front of a homeowner's home, which was located about a mile from the stadium. Two hours after the earthquake struck, a pedestrian was walking in front of the homeowner's home, smoking a cigarette. When he discarded his lighted cigarette butt in the street, the gasoline exploded. The explosion blew the windows out of the homeowner's home. The homeowner, who was sitting in the living room watching television, was struck by the flying glass and injured. If the homeowner asserts a claim for his injuries against the sportsman, which of the following is the sportsman's best defense?",

        "A": "The earthquake was an act of God.",

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The earthquake caused the stadium to collapse, which led to the press box falling on the car and causing the gasoline spill. This was an unforeseeable event and can be considered an act of God, so option A is not the best defense.\n\n2. The sportsman's negligence in maintaining the stadium may have contributed to the collapse, but it can be argued that this negligence merely created a passive condition and was not the active cause of the homeowner's injury. The direct cause of the injury was the pedestrian's act of discarding the lighted cigarette, so option B is not the best defense.\n\n3. The sportsman could reasonably have been expected to foresee the danger of the stadium collapsing and causing damage to nearby property, but it would be difficult to foresee the specific chain of events that led to the homeowner's injury. Therefore, option C is not the best defense.\n\n4. The pedestrian's act of discarding the lighted cigarette directly sparked the explosion that caused the homeowner's injury. This act was the proximate cause of the injury, and it was not directly caused by the sportsman's actions or negligence. Therefore, option D is the best defense for the sportsman.\n\nIn conclusion, the best defense for the sportsman in this scenario is that the pedestrian's act of discarding the lighted cigarette was the proximate cause of the homeowner's injury."
