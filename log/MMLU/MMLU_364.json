While eating the corn later that evening, the customer was injured by a small piece of glass in the corn. The customer sued the canning company that had processed and canned the corn.

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This suggests that the glass was likely present in the can of corn when it was processed and canned by the canning company. \n\nThe concept of negligence in a legal case requires establishing that the defendant (in this case, the canning company) owed a duty of care to the plaintiff (the customer), breached that duty, and that the breach of duty caused harm to the plaintiff. The evidence presented by the customer suggests that the canning company may have breached its duty of care by allowing glass to be present in the can of corn, which caused harm to the customer.\n\nAnswer:\nConsidering the evidence presented by the customer and the concept of negligence, option C: \"Yes, because a jury may reasonably infer that the canning company acted negligently,\" is the most likely correct choice. The evidence suggests that the canning company may have breached its duty of care, and a jury could reasonably infer negligence based on the evidence presented."
