There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This is because the surface area to volume ratio is higher for smaller objects, leading to a faster rate of heat loss.\n\nWhen an object is smaller, it has a larger surface area relative to its volume. This means that there is more surface area through which heat can escape compared to the amount of heat-producing volume inside the object. As a result, smaller objects lose heat more quickly than larger objects.\n\nSimilarly, a small planet has a higher surface area to volume ratio compared to a larger planet. This means that small planets can lose their interior heat more quickly than larger planets due to their higher surface area relative to their volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: a large baked potato takes longer to cool than a small baked potato, because it illustrates the same principle of surface area to volume ratio affecting the rate of heat loss."

This is because both scenarios involve a higher surface area to volume ratio, leading to a faster rate of heat loss."
