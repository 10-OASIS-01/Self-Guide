There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This term suggests that social relationships were divided or segmented in some way.\n\nOption A does not directly relate to the concept of social relationships being 'segmental'. It refers to the geographical confinement of social relationships, which is not the same as being segmented.\n\nOption C also does not directly relate to the concept of social relationships being 'segmental'. It refers to distinctive patterns of activity for each social class, which is not the same as being segmented.\n\nOption D mentions face to face interaction with close friends and family, which is a characteristic of social relationships, but it does not directly address the concept of social relationships being 'segmental'.\n\nOption B, however, directly addresses the concept of social relationships being 'segmental'. It suggests that people knew each other only through specific, situational roles, and not as whole, rounded individuals. This aligns with the idea of social relationships being segmented, as individuals are only known within specific contexts or roles, rather than as complete, multifaceted individuals.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning process, the most fitting answer to Wirth's statement would be option B: \"people knew each other only through specific, situational roles, and not as whole, rounded individuals\"."
