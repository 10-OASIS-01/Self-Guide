There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The formula for cost of goods manufactured is:\n\nBeginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Manufactured - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold\n\nWe are given the beginning inventory of finished goods as $16,000 and the ending inventory of finished goods as $21,000.

Let's re-evaluate the data and calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the data, it seems that the Gross Margin from Sales and the Operating Expenses are not relevant to the calculation of the Cost of Goods Manufactured. Instead, we should focus on the Beginning Inventory, Ending Inventory, and Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nUsing the formula for Cost of Goods Manufactured:\n\nCost of Goods Manufactured = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Purchased - Ending Inventory\nCost of Goods Manufactured = $16,000 + $43,000 - $21,000\nCost of Goods Manufactured = $38,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $38,000."
