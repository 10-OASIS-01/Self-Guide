There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The options A, B, C, and D are then considered in the second reasoning process, and options B and C are eliminated based on the calculated result. The focus then shifts to options A and D, with a reminder to consider the relationship between the reciprocal of a number and the result of dividing another number by its reciprocal.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the combined reasoning processes, the most likely correct answer is option B: 1815. This is because both reasoning processes lead to the same result of 1815 when dividing 11 by the reciprocal of 1815 ÷ 11. Therefore, option B aligns with the calculated result and the reasoning steps followed."
