There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The BMR is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about 12 hours of fasting in humans).\n\nThe Harris-Benedict equation is commonly used to calculate BMR. For women, the equation is:\nBMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)\n\nGiven that the woman is sedentary, we will use the BMR to calculate her Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) using the following formula:\nTDEE = BMR x Activity Level\n\nThe activity level for a sedentary individual is 1.2.\n\nNow, let's calculate the BMR using the Harris-Benedict equation and then use the TDEE formula to find the energy need of the woman.\n\nBased on this information, what do you think the energy need of the sedentary 43-year old woman who weighs 63 kg is?"
