There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

In other words, it suggests that our actions are entirely predetermined and not within our control.\n\nNow, let's consider Taylor's argument.

Hard determinism is the belief that all events, including human actions, are determined by previous causes and that free will is an illusion.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\nA: 'the findings of science' - This could be a potential conflict, as some scientific findings may support determinism, but it's not specific to hard determinism.\nB: 'the fact of deliberation and our sense that some actions are up to us' - This seems to be the most likely conflict, as hard determinism denies the existence of free will and the ability to make choices.\nC: 'the fact of deliberation and indeterminism' - This doesn't necessarily conflict with hard determinism, as indeterminism is a different philosophical position.\nD: 'scientific determinism' - This is related to option A and doesn't specifically address hard determinism.\n\nBased on the options, it seems that option B, 'the fact of deliberation and our sense that some actions are up to us', is the most likely conflict with hard determinism. This is because hard determinism denies the existence of free will and the ability to make choices, which directly contradicts our sense of agency and deliberation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B: 'the fact of deliberation and our sense that some actions are up to us'."
