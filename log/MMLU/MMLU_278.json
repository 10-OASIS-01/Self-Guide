There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

            "content": "To solve this problem, I will first recall some basic information about Homo habilis and their brain size. Homo habilis is an extinct species of the genus Homo, and they are considered one of the earliest members of the human genus. Their brain size is smaller compared to modern humans.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options given:\nA: 300 cc.\nB: 450 cc.\nC: 700 cc.\nD: 1200 cc.\n\nI know that modern humans have an average brain size of around 1300-1400 cc, so it is unlikely that Homo habilis had a brain size of 1200 cc (option D). This leaves us with options A, B, and C.\n\nConsidering that Homo habilis had a smaller brain size compared to modern humans, I would eliminate option C (700 cc) as it is closer to the average brain size of modern humans.\n\nThis leaves us with options A (300 cc) and B (450 cc). Given that Homo habilis had a smaller brain size but still larger than earlier hominins, I would lean towards option B (450 cc) as a more reasonable estimate for the mean size of a Homo habilis brain.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would choose option B: 450 cc as the mean size of a Homo habilis brain."
