There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

Realists argue that the power vacuum left by the decline of European colonial powers and the weakened state of the United States after World War II created an opportunity for the Soviet Union to expand its influence. This aligns with option B and C.\n\nTo guide you further, we need to consider the specific actions and policies of the Soviet Union and how they contributed to the onset of the Cold War.

Realists believe that states are the primary actors in international relations and that they are primarily motivated by their own self-interest and the pursuit of power. They also believe that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority to enforce rules and agreements between states.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\nA: Ideological differences - This is a common explanation for the Cold War, as the ideological differences between the capitalist West and the communist East were a major source of tension. However, from a Realist perspective, this alone may not fully account for the onset of the Cold War.\n\nB: A power vacuum - Realists often argue that conflicts arise when there is a power vacuum, meaning a lack of clear and stable power structures. This can lead to competition and conflict as states seek to fill the vacuum and establish their own power.\n\nC: The expansionist nature of the Soviet Union - Realists would see the Soviet Union's expansionist actions as a rational pursuit of power and influence in the international system. They would argue that the Soviet Union's actions were driven by its own self-interest and desire for security.\n\nD: Both B and C - This option combines the ideas of a power vacuum and the expansionist nature of the Soviet Union, both of which are consistent with Realist thinking.\n\nFrom a Realist perspective, the most likely explanation for the onset of the Cold War would be a combination of a power vacuum and the expansionist nature of the Soviet Union. The power vacuum created by the end of World War II allowed for increased competition and tension between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, and the Soviet Union's expansionist actions can be seen as a rational response to this environment.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D: Both B and C."
