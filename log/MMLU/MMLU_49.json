There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

A universalizing religion is one that actively seeks converts to its faith regardless of ethnic or cultural background. It aims to appeal to all people, not just those of a particular group. \n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\nA. Taoism\nB. Islam\nC. Shintoism\nD. Confucianism\n\nWe can eliminate options A, C, and D because they are not universalizing religions. Taoism and Confucianism are primarily practiced in China and are closely tied to Chinese culture, while Shintoism is primarily practiced in Japan and is closely tied to Japanese culture.\n\nNow, let's focus on option B, Islam. Islam is a universalizing religion because it actively seeks converts from all over the world, regardless of their cultural or ethnic background.

A universalizing religion is a religion that actively seeks converts and is open to all people regardless of their background or ethnicity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\nA: Taoism - Taoism is not a universalizing religion. It is primarily practiced in China and does not actively seek converts.\nB: Islam - Islam is a universalizing religion. It actively seeks converts and is open to people of all backgrounds.\nC: Shintoism - Shintoism is not a universalizing religion.

It is more of a philosophy and ethical system rather than a religion, and it is primarily practiced in East Asia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is B: Islam.
