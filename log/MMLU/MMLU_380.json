There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

A function is collision resistant if it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same output. In other words, it should be difficult to find (H, m) and (H', m') such that h(H, m) = h(H', m') and (H, m) ≠ (H', m').\n\nNow, let's analyze the given function h(H, m) = E(m, H). This function takes two inputs, H and m, and produces an output using some encryption function E. The problem statement suggests that this resulting function h(\\cdot,\\cdot) is not collision resistant.\n\nTo understand why, we are given four options for constructing H' using random (H, m, m'):\n\nA: H’=D(m’, E(m,H))\nB: H’=E(m’,D(m,H))\nC: H’=E(m’,E(m,H))\nD: H’=D(m’,D(m,H))\n\nWe need to analyze each option and determine which one leads to a collision in the resulting function h(\\cdot,\\cdot).\n\nOption A: H’=D(m’, E(m,H))\nThis option involves decrypting E(m, H) using m' to obtain H'. It is not immediately clear whether this would lead to a collision, so we need to further analyze the implications of this operation.\n\nOption B: H’=E(m’,D(m,H))\nThis option involves encrypting D(m, H) using m' to obtain H'. Similar to option A, we need to analyze the implications of this operation.\n\nOption C: H’=E(m’,E(m,H))\nThis option involves encrypting E(m, H) using m' to obtain H'. Again, we need to analyze the implications of this operation.\n\nOption D: H’=D(m’,D(m,H))\nThis option involves decrypting D(m, H) using m' to obtain H'. As with the other options, we need to analyze the implications of this operation.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we need to determine which one leads to a collision in the resulting function h(\\cdot,\\cdot). This may involve considering the properties of the encryption and decryption functions, as well as the relationship between the inputs H, m, and m'.\n\nBy carefully analyzing each option and considering the properties of the encryption and decryption functions, we can determine why the resulting function h(\\cdot,\\cdot) is not collision resistant and provide a reasoning process for our conclusion."

This is because using the encryption function E twice on different inputs can potentially result in the same output, leading to a collision.
