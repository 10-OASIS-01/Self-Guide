Acceptance was to be not later than October 10.  Madison posted his acceptance on the 3rd of October.  The acceptance arrived on October 7.

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

On October 4, Arthur sold the tract of land to Larson and mailed notice of the sale to Madison, which arrived on October 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the legal principles involved in this scenario.

If the offer was effectively revoked by the sale, then Madison's acceptance would not be valid.\n\nC: \"Arthur could not revoke the offer to sell the land until after October 10.\"\nThis option does not seem to be correct because Arthur sold the land to Larson on October 4, before the specified date of October 10.\n\nD: \"Madison's acceptance was not valid since he was deemed to have notice of revocation prior to the acceptance.\"\nThis option seems to be a possibility. If Madison was deemed to have notice of the revocation prior to his acceptance, then his acceptance would not be valid.\n\nBased on the analysis, it seems that options B and D are the most likely correct answers. However, we need to consider the legal principles of offer and acceptance, revocation, and the concept of communication of acceptance and revocation to determine the correct answer."

Madison's acceptance may not be valid since he was deemed to have notice of revocation prior to his acceptance. This is because Arthur had already sold the land to Larson and sent notice of the sale before Madison's acceptance arrived, which could be considered as effective revocation of the initial offer."
