There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. \"Patients usually have a BMI<17.5 kg/m2\": This statement is not true for Bulimia Nervosa. In fact, individuals with Bulimia Nervosa often fall within the normal or overweight range of BMI.\n\nB. \"It has an equal gender distribution\": This statement is not true. Bulimia Nervosa is more common in females than in males.\n\nC. \"Some patients have purging without binge eating episodes\": This statement is true. Some individuals with Bulimia Nervosa may engage in purging behaviors without necessarily having binge eating episodes.\n\nD. \"Self-induced vomiting is the most frequent compensatory behavior\": This statement is true. Self-induced vomiting is one of the most common compensatory behaviors in individuals with Bulimia Nervosa.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can see that options C and D are both true statements about Bulimia Nervosa. However, we need to consider which statement best represents a characteristic that is consistently associated with the disorder.\n\nNow, let's think about the typical pattern of behaviors in individuals with Bulimia Nervosa and which behavior is more central to the diagnosis of the disorder.\n\nConsidering this information, which option do you think is the most accurate representation of a characteristic of Bulimia Nervosa?"

Bulimia Nervosa is more common in females than in males, so it does not have an equal gender distribution.\n\nC: \"Some patients have purging without binge eating episodes\"\n- This statement is true.
