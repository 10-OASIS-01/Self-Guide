There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

Therefore, it is a noticeable consequence.\n\nB: High rates of morbidity amongst infected patients posed a direct threat to human security - This consequence directly relates to the threat to human security, which is a key aspect of security studies. Therefore, it is a noticeable consequence.\n\nC: Quarantine and isolation procedures were implemented by some national health agencies - This consequence is related to the implementation of security measures to control the spread of the disease, which is relevant to security studies. Therefore, it is a noticeable consequence.\n\nD: Detrimental impacts on the travel and tourism industry - This consequence is related to the economic and social impacts of the outbreak, but it is not directly related to security studies. Therefore, it is the answer to the question and was not a noticeable consequence of the SARS outbreak in terms of security studies.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is D: There were detrimental impacts on the travel and tourism industry, as people became reluctant to expose themselves to areas or situations which they deemed to pose a higher risk of infection."
