There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

Both options are related to theories of development, but they approach the idea of disruption and reorganization differently.\n\nThe Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) model emphasizes the idea of individuals adapting to changes in their environment by selecting and optimizing their resources, as well as compensating for losses. This model does not explicitly address the concept of disruption leading to reorganization for more adaptive functioning.\n\nOn the other hand, the dynamic systems theory focuses on the interconnectedness and interdependence of various factors in development, highlighting how changes in one domain can lead to reorganization and adaptation in the entire system.
