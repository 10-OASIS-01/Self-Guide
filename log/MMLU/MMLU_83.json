There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This is the concept that Sasha is demonstrating when she plays \"peek-a-boo\" with her mother. By covering her face and then revealing it, Sasha is showing that she understands that her mother still exists even when she cannot see her.

It doesn't seem to be relevant to Sasha's behavior either.\n\nC: 'metacognition' - This refers to thinking about one's own thinking, which doesn't seem to be directly related to Sasha's behavior.\n\nD: 'object permanence' - This refers to the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched. This seems to be the most relevant option, as playing \"peek-a-boo\" involves the concept of object permanence.\n\nGiven Sasha's behavior of enjoying \"peek-a-boo,\" it seems that she has developed an understanding of object permanence, which is the ability to realize that her mother is still present even when she temporarily disappears from view during the game.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 'object permanence.' Sasha's enjoyment of \"peek-a-boo\" indicates that she has developed a sense of object permanence."
