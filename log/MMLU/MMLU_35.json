    "question": "A homeowner owned a single-story ranch- style home that was her primary residence. The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments. Thereupon, the tenant, who had paid no rent for the final two months, moved out. After the sale was finalized, the homeowner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds. Which of the following statements, if true, most persuasively supports the tenant's contention that he is entitled to recover at least $4,000 from the owner (or the equivalent of one-half of the sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, minus two months' unpaid rent at $500 per month)?",

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The tenant and the homeowner entered into an agreement that stated the tenant would receive one-half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000 as compensation for the room addition he built onto the home.\n\n2. The agreement also allowed the tenant to remain on the land until the sale was finalized, at a monthly rent of $500.\n\n3. The condition for the tenant to receive his share of the proceeds was that he would be allowed to remain on the land until the sale was finalized. This condition has occurred, as the tenant did remain on the land until the sale was finalized.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the terms of the agreement, the tenant is entitled to his share of the proceeds from the sale, which would be at least $4,000 (half of the $6,000 excess from the sale price of $206,000 over the $200,000 appraised market value).\n\nOption C most persuasively supports the tenant's contention because it directly addresses the terms of the agreement and the fulfillment of the condition for the tenant to receive his share of the proceeds.
