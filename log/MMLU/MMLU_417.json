There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This option also seems plausible based on the given statement.\n\nBased on the analysis, options A, B, and D all seem plausible. However, since the statement specifically mentions that executive directors are responsible for running the firm, options A and B, which include this responsibility, are the most fitting.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer based on the given statement would be either option A or B."

This includes considering their role in decision-making, leadership, and strategic planning. We should also consider which combination of responsibilities aligns most closely with the overall responsibilities of executive directors in a firm.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the combined reasoning process, the most likely combination of responsibilities that aligns with the role of executive directors in running the firm is option B: '1,3'. This option indicates that executive directors are responsible for running the firm (task 1) and another unspecified task (task 3). This aligns with their essential functions in decision-making and strategic planning while overseeing the firm's operations. Therefore, option B is the most fitting based on the given statement and the analysis of executive directors' responsibilities."
