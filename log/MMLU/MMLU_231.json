There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The question states that tidal gauges indicate mean global sea level since the late 1800s. This means we are looking at a long-term trend in sea level.\n\nThe consensus among scientists is also mentioned, and it is important to consider their expertise in this matter.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can eliminate options B and D. Sea level cannot have remained constant or increased by 20 centimeters since the late 1800s, as this does not align with scientific consensus and the data from tidal gauges.\n\nThis leaves us with options A and C. We need to consider the long-term trend indicated by tidal gauges and the consensus among scientists. Given that there is consensus among scientists that sea level will continue to rise, option C seems more likely than option A.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most reasonable answer is:\nC: increased by about 5 centimeters (2 inches); will continue to rise.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasoning process involved analyzing the long-term trend indicated by tidal gauges, considering the consensus among scientists, and eliminating options that did not align with this information."
