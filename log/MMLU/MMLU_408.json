There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

P ≡ Q\n2. ~Q ≡ R\n3. R ≡ P\n4. S ≡ ~P\n5. S ≡ R\n\nWe start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. We assume that the set of propositions is inconsistent and then derive a contradiction. If we cannot derive a contradiction, then the set of propositions is consistent.\n\nAssume the set of propositions is inconsistent:\n\n~(P ≡ Q) ∨ ~(~Q ≡ R) ∨ ~(R ≡ P) ∨ ~(S ≡ ~P) ∨ ~(S ≡ R)\n\nUsing the truth table, we can check each proposition and see if the assumption leads to a contradiction. If it does not, then the set of propositions is consistent.\n\nAfter analyzing the truth table and checking each proposition, we find that the assumption does not lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the set of propositions is consistent.\n\nNow, let's choose an option with a consistent valuation. Looking at the truth table, we can see that the consistent valuation occurs when P and Q are true, R is false, and S is true. Therefore, the consistent valuation is when P and Q are true, R is false, and S is true. This corresponds to option D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when R and S are true and P and Q are false.\n\nSo, the answer is option D: Consistent. Consistent valuation when R and S are true and P and Q are false."
