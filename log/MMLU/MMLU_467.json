There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

According to Marquis, one of the benefits of his position is that it provides a plausible analysis of personhood. This means that Marquis' position offers a convincing explanation of what it means to be a person and how that relates to the morality of abortion.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\nA. It gets around problems with personhood accounts such as how to account for infanticide being wrong.\nB. It provides a plausible analysis of personhood.\nC. both of the above\nD. neither of the above\n\nWe can eliminate option D because we know that Marquis' position does offer a benefit related to personhood analysis. \n\nNow, let's focus on options A and B. Option A refers to getting around problems with personhood accounts, specifically in relation to infanticide. This is a potential benefit of Marquis' position, as it addresses a common criticism of personhood accounts in the context of abortion. Option B directly aligns with the known benefit of Marquis' position.\n\nTo guide you further, we need to consider the relationship between these two potential benefits and how they contribute to Marquis' overall position on abortion.

He believes that what makes killing wrong is not the effect it has on the victim's current state, but rather the fact that it deprives the victim of a valuable future.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\nA: \"It gets around problems with personhood accounts such as how to account for infanticide being wrong.\"\nThis statement suggests that Marquis' position on abortion addresses issues with personhood accounts, such as the problem of justifying why infanticide is wrong. This is a potential benefit of his position.\n\nB: \"It provides a plausible analysis of personhood.\"\nThis statement suggests that Marquis' position offers a plausible understanding of personhood.
