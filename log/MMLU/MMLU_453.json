There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

On the other hand, Parfit argues for a \"prior existence\" approach, where he suggests that it is better to relieve the agony of one stranger rather than the minor pain of another, as the agony is more severe and immediate.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\nA.

In this case, we should prioritize relieving the agony of one stranger over the minor pain of another, because the agony is more severe and therefore takes precedence.\n\nOn the other hand, Parfit argues for a \"prior existence\" view, which means that we should prioritize relieving the minor pain of the existing person over the potential agony of a future person. In this case, Parfit would argue that we should prioritize relieving the minor pain of the existing person, as their pain is currently being experienced.\n\nGiven these perspectives, the correct answer to the question is A: \"Taurek and Parfit.\" Both Taurek and Parfit would endorse the view that we ought to relieve the agony of one stranger rather than the minor pain of another, but for different reasons based on their respective ethical theories.\n\nIn conclusion, when faced with ethical dilemmas, it is important to consider different perspectives and reasoning behind each view in order to make an informed decision."
