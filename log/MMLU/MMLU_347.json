She pays the clerk with a twenty-dollar bill. The clerk subtracts the total cost of the bananas from the twenty-dollar bill to determine the amount of change to give Zelma.

There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This expression suggests that the change is the difference between 0.40 times the pounds of bananas and twenty dollars. Does this seem like the correct way to calculate the change based on the scenario?\n\nNow, let's think about the scenario and the process of calculating change. Consider the cost of the bananas and how it relates to the twenty-dollar bill. Which expression do you think accurately represents the amount of change Zelma should receive?
