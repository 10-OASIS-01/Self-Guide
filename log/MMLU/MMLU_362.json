There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

In order to determine in which situation this expression can be used, let's analyze each option:\n\nA: \"There are 8 buses with 64 students on each bus.\"\nIn this situation, the expression 64 + 8 can be used to find the total number of students if there are 8 buses with 64 students on each bus. By adding 64 to 8, we can find the total number of students.\n\nB: \"Ms. Vance has 8 pens and 64 pencils in a container.\"\nIn this situation, the expression 64 + 8 can be used to find the total number of writing instruments in the container. By adding 64 pencils to 8 pens, we can find the total number of writing instruments.\n\nC: \"There are 64 books in a bookcase and 8 books are removed.\"\nIn this situation, the expression 64 + 8 can be used to find the total number of books in the bookcase after 8 books are removed. By adding 64 to 8, we can find the original total number of books and then subtract 8 to find the new total.\n\nD: \"Mr. Juarez has 64 cups and puts an equal number on each of 8 tables.\"\nIn this situation, the expression 64 + 8 can be used to find the number of cups placed on each table if Mr. Juarez puts an equal number on each of 8 tables. By adding 64 cups to 8 tables, we can find the total number of cups placed on each table.\n\nAfter analyzing each situation, it is clear that option A is the correct situation where the expression 64 + 8 can be used. Therefore, the correct answer is A: \"There are 8 buses with 64 students on each bus.\""
