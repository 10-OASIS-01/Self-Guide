There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

According to the World Bank, as of 2020, the percentage of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa living on less than $1.90 a day is a widely recognized measure of extreme poverty.\n\nNext, we need to consider the economic and social factors that contribute to poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. This may include issues such as access to education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and infrastructure.\n\nBased on this information, we can start to eliminate some of the options. For example, we can reasonably assume that the percentage is not as low as 10% or 20%, given the economic challenges faced by many countries in the region.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options. Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa is a complex issue influenced by a variety of factors, including economic growth, political stability, and social development.

This means that anyone living on less than $1.90 per day is considered to be living in extreme poverty.\n\nAs of 2020, the World Bank reported that approximately 41% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa was living in extreme poverty. This means that the correct answer to the question is C: 40%.\n\nMy reasoning process for arriving at this answer involved looking up the latest data on poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa and understanding the poverty line set by the World Bank.
