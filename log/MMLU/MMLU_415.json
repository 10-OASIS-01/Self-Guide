There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The \"p\" represents the number of autoregressive terms, the \"d\" represents the number of differences needed for stationarity, and the \"q\" represents the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.\n\nNow, let's consider each statement:\n\n(i) The \"I\" stands for independent\nThis statement is not accurate. The \"I\" in ARIMA stands for differencing, not independent.

Taking the logs of prices and differencing once is equivalent to working with continuously compounded returns.\n\n(iii) It is plausible for financial time series that the optimal value of d could be 2 or 3.\nThis statement is also true. In some cases, financial time series may require higher orders of differencing (d) to achieve stationarity.\n\n(iv) The estimation of ARIMA models is incompatible with the notion of cointegration\nThis statement is not accurate. ARIMA models can be used in conjunction with cointegration analysis, especially in the context of integrated time series.\n\nNow that we have analyzed each statement, we can consider which ones are true and which ones are not.
