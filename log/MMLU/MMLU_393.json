There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

The key fact is that US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary. This fact suggests that the United States was not truly neutral in its financial support during the war.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\nA: US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary\nB: US banks funded Germany and Austria-Hungary much more than the allies\nC: Wilson secretly favoured the German position\nD: None of the above\n\nOption A aligns with the fact that US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary, so it seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B contradicts the fact, so it can be eliminated.\n\nOption C is not supported by the given fact, so it can also be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing the given fact and reasoning through the options, we can determine that the fact that impinged upon America's 'neutral' stance towards the belligerent in World War I between 1915 and 1917 was that US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary."
