Which of the following methods is the best way for her to choose a random sample of the students at her school?\n            {'A': 'selecting ten students from each homeroom', 'B': 'selecting members of the girls’ softball team', 'C': 'selecting members of the boys’ basketball team', 'D': 'selecting students who like her favorite flavor of ice cream'}\n            please provide a detailed analysis.\n            Note: Since your responsibility is to guide students in answering the question,\n            your analysis should think step by step, Please note that your role is to guide them step by step through the problem, so please don't give them the final result\n            Here's a possible example:\n            Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n            First, we need to understand the process of speciation.\n            Speciation occurs when a single population becomes two or more reproductively isolated populations, meaning they can no longer interbreed.\n            Over time, these isolated populations can accumulate genetic differences, leading to the formation of new species.\n            In this scenario, the gradual drop in the water level of the large lake divided the single population of fish into three smaller, isolated populations.\n            After many generations, it was determined that the three populations of fish had become three separate species.\n            Now, let's consider the options provided:\n            A. There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "
