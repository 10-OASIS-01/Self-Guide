There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

They are responsible for involuntary movements, such as the contraction of blood vessels and the movement of food through the digestive system.\n\nNext, I need to consider the components of smooth muscle cells. Actin and myosin are both contractile proteins found in muscle cells. Actin is involved in the formation of thin filaments, while myosin is involved in the formation of thick filaments.\n\nNow, I need to consider the options provided:\nA: Actin but not myosin.\nB: Myosin but not actin.\nC: Actin and myosin arranged irregularly.\nD: Actin and myosin arranged in parallel arrays.\n\nBased on my knowledge of muscle cells, I know that both actin and myosin are present in smooth muscle cells. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated.\n\nOption C states that actin and myosin are arranged irregularly. This is not accurate, as the arrangement of actin and myosin in smooth muscle cells is not irregular, but rather organized in a specific pattern to allow for efficient contraction. Therefore, option C can be eliminated.\n\nThis leaves us with option D, which states that actin and myosin are arranged in parallel arrays. This is the correct answer, as the arrangement of actin and myosin in smooth muscle cells is indeed parallel, allowing for the coordinated contraction of the muscle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: actin and myosin arranged in parallel arrays."
