There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

Separatism: This refers to the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group.\nB.

Containment: This is a foreign policy strategy in which a powerful nation seeks to prevent the expansion of an adversary by blocking its influence or expansion.\nD. Domino theory: This is a theory that speculated that if one country in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect.\n\nGiven the context of the question, the practice being described is the manipulation of voting district boundaries to give an unfair advantage to one political party.
