There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species. \n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species. \n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species. \n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species. \n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species. \n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels. \n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon. \n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time. \n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B). \n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species. \n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression. \n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct? \n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

According to Manne, sexism involves the patriarchy-reinforcing naturalization of sex differences. This means that sexism is not just about the belief that men and women are different (option B), but it also involves the societal reinforcement and normalization of these differences in a way that upholds patriarchal power structures.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\nA.

Option B is too simplistic and does not encompass the societal and structural aspects of sexism. Options C and D are extreme manifestations of sexism, but they do not fully capture the everyday, normalized aspects of sexism that Manne's definition focuses on.\n\nNow, let's focus on option A. This option aligns with Manne's definition of sexism as the naturalization of sex differences that reinforce patriarchal power structures. It encompasses the societal and structural aspects of sexism that Manne discusses in her work.\n\nTo guide you further, let's consider how the naturalization of sex differences can manifest in different aspects of society, such as in gender roles, expectations, and norms.
