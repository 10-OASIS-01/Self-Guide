There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This claim suggests that easy access to drugs leads to a rise in addiction rates.\n\nOption B argues that even with easy access to drugs, most drug users don't become addicts. This claim implies that easy access to drugs does not necessarily result in widespread addiction.\n\nOption C asserts that legal restrictions on drug use are justified because illegal drugs are inherently addictive. This claim suggests that the addictive nature of illegal drugs justifies legal restrictions.\n\nOption D states that only by restricting access to drugs can we solve the drug problem. This claim implies that the solution to the drug problem lies in restricting access to drugs.\n\nAfter carefully considering each option, it seems that option D, \"Only by restricting access to drugs can we solve the drug problem,\" is the central claim in Shapiro's argument. This claim suggests that the key to addressing the drug problem is through restricting access to drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, the central claim in Shapiro's argument appears to be option D. This claim emphasizes the importance of restricting access to drugs as a solution to the drug problem."
