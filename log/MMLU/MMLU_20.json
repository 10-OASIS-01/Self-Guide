There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This process releases a large amount of energy.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent (E=mc^2). This means that when energy is released in a nuclear reaction, a small amount of mass is also converted into energy.\n\nSo, when energy is released by the process of fusion, the total mass of the material after the event is actually less.
