There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This means that option A, 'high rewards and incentives ensure that the most skilled individuals will take the most important social positions', aligns with the functionalist theory of inequality.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options provided:\nB.

Functionalism is a sociological perspective that views society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote stability and solidarity. From a functionalist perspective, inequality may be seen as functional if it serves a purpose in maintaining social order and stability.\n\nOption A aligns with the functionalist perspective as it suggests that high rewards and incentives ensure that the most skilled individuals take important social positions, which can be seen as promoting social order and stability.\n\nOption B also aligns with the functionalist perspective as it suggests that inequality is inevitable, which implies that it serves a purpose in maintaining social order.\n\nOption C contradicts the functionalist perspective by suggesting that inequality serves no social function and should be eradicated.\n\nOption D also contradicts the functionalist perspective by suggesting that the idea of meritocracy is dangerous, which goes against the idea of rewarding individuals based on their abilities and achievements.\n\nBased on the analysis, options A and B align with the functionalist theory of inequality, while options C and D contradict it. Therefore, the most fitting answer according to the functionalist theory of inequality is option A: 'high rewards and incentives ensure that the most skilled individuals will take the most important social positions'."
