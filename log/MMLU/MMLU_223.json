There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This means that the same natural processes we see today, such as erosion, volcanic activity, and sedimentation, have been at work throughout Earth's history.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\nA. The evolutionary theory: This theory explains how species change over time through the process of natural selection. While it is related to the concept of uniformitarianism in the sense that it operates over long periods of time, it does not specifically address geological processes and natural laws.\n\nB. The law of superposition: This law states that in any undisturbed sequence of rock layers, the youngest rocks are on top and the oldest are on the bottom. While this is a fundamental principle in geology, it does not directly address the idea that present-day geological processes have operated in the past.\n\nC. The law of thermodynamics: This law describes the behavior of energy in a system. While it is a fundamental principle in physics, it does not specifically address geological processes and natural laws.\n\nD. The principle of uniformitarianism: This principle directly states that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past.
