There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

A double standard implies that two different entities or actions are being judged or treated differently under similar circumstances. In this case, we are looking at how states and nonstate entities are judged in terms of their use of violence.\n\nOption A suggests that violence by nonstate entities is more easily accepted than state violence. This would mean that there is a double standard in favor of nonstate entities.\n\nOption B suggests that state violence is treated differently from nonmilitary action by the state, such as economic sanctions. This implies a double standard in the way different actions by the state are judged.\n\nOption C suggests that state violence is more easily accepted than violence by nonstate entities. This would also indicate a double standard in favor of the state.\n\nOption D suggests that state violence is evaluated via just war theory, while violence by nonstate entities is evaluated via consequentialism. This implies a difference in the criteria used to judge the actions of states and nonstate entities.\n\nBased on these options, it seems that the most fitting answer to the question is option B. This is because it addresses the different treatment of state violence and nonmilitary state actions, indicating a double standard in the way these actions are judged.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasoning process involved analyzing each option in relation to the concept of a \"double standard\" and determining which option best fits the given context."

State violence may be seen as more legitimate due to its authority and perceived responsibility for maintaining order, while violence by nonstate entities may be viewed as illegitimate and disruptive.\n\nConsidering this, we can eliminate option C, which suggests that state violence is more easily accepted than violence by nonstate entities, as it does not align with the typical perception of state authority.\n\nOption D introduces the idea of different evaluation frameworks for state and nonstate violence, which is a plausible explanation for the double standard. However, it may not fully capture the broader societal and political factors that contribute to the differential treatment of state and nonstate violence.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is option A, which suggests that violence by nonstate entities is more easily accepted than state violence. This aligns with the idea that state violence is often held to a higher standard and scrutinized more closely due to its authority and responsibility.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the combined reasoning processes, the most fitting answer is option A: \"violence by nonstate entities is more easily accepted than state violence.\" This aligns with the differential treatment of state and nonstate violence in the international arena and the societal and political factors that contribute to this double standard."
