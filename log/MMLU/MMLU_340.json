There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.\n            B. There are differences in the amino acid specified by each codon among the species.\n            C. There are differences in the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres among the species.\n            D. There are differences in the composition of ribosomes among the species.\n            We can eliminate options C and D because they are not directly related to genetic differences that would lead to the formation of separate species.\n            Now, let's focus on options A and B. Both options refer to genetic differences, but they are at different levels.\n            Option A refers to nucleotide sequences of gene alleles, while option B refers to the amino acids specified by each codon.\n            As the populations of fish became reproductively isolated and evolved separately, it is likely that genetic differences accumulated over time.\n            These differences could manifest as changes in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles (option A) or differences in the amino acid specified by each codon (option B).\n            To guide you further, we need to consider which level of genetic differences is more likely to be associated with the formation of separate species.\n            Think about the relationship between nucleotide sequences, codons, and the resulting amino acids in the process of gene expression.\n            Based on this information, which option do you think is most likely correct?\n            Please analyze and reason step by step, and provide your answer.\n            "

This means that if you own one share of the stock, you also have one right to purchase additional shares at a discounted price.\n\nStep 2: Understand the subscription rights\nFour rights are required to purchase an additional share of common stock at the subscription price of $54 per share. This means that in order to buy one additional share at the discounted price, you need to have four rights.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the theoretical value of a right\nTo calculate the theoretical value of a right, we can compare the market price of the stock to the subscription price and the number of rights needed to purchase an additional share.\n\nThe market price of the stock is $60, and the subscription price is $54. This means that the discount when using a subscription right is $60 - $54 = $6.\n\nSince it takes four rights to purchase an additional share at the discounted price, the theoretical value of one right can be calculated as $6 / 4 = $1.50.\n\nStep 4: Choose the closest option\nThe theoretical value of a right is closest to $1.50, which corresponds to option C.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical value of a right is closest to $1.50.\n\nSo, the answer is C: $1.50."
