We also know that Michele is the mother of Manuel and Jami, and that Gino is the brother of Manuel and Jami.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how Joseph is related to Charlie. We know that Joseph is the uncle of Manuel, so that means Joseph is the brother of either Kenneth or Michele. Since we don't have any information about Kenneth or Michele having any siblings, we can't determine which one is Joseph's sibling.\n\nHowever, we do know that Gino is the brother of Jami, and Jami is the daughter of Michele. So, if Joseph is the brother of Michele, then he would be the uncle of Jami as well. And since Gino is the brother of Jami, that would make Joseph the uncle of Gino as well.\n\nSo, based on the information we have, it seems likely that Joseph is the brother of Michele, making him the uncle of both Jami and Gino.
