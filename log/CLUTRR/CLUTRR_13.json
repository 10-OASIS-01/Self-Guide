We know that Debra is the mother of Brian and Morgan, and Victor is the brother of Cyrus. Since there is no direct mention of Victor being related to Debra, we need to find a common ancestor or relative between Victor and Debra to establish their relationship.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the relationships\nTo determine the relationship between Victor and Debra, we need to look for any other family members mentioned in the story who could potentially connect them. We know that Kerrie is the mother of Joy and Morgan, and Cyrus is the brother of Kerrie. Since Morgan is the sister of Darryl, and Darryl is the son of Valerie, who is the sister of Melissa, we can see that there is no direct connection between Victor and Debra through the relationships mentioned in the story.\n\nStep 5: Consider alternative possibilities\nGiven the information provided in the story, it seems that there is no direct relationship mentioned between Victor and Debra. However, it's important to consider that there may be other family members or relationships not explicitly mentioned in the story that could connect Victor and Debra.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the story, there is no direct relationship mentioned between Victor and Debra. It's possible that there may be other family members or relationships not explicitly mentioned in the story that could connect them, but based on the information given, we cannot determine their relationship."
