Since Donald is Gabrielle's grandson, and Russell played chess with his brother Donald, we can infer that Russell is either Gabrielle's son or son-in-law.\n\nStep 4: Consider the possibilities\nBased on the information given, there are two possible relationships between Russell and Gabrielle:\n1. Russell is Gabrielle's son\n2. Russell is Gabrielle's son-in-law\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the possibilities\nTo determine which of the two possibilities is correct, we need to consider the most common family relationships. In most cases, Russell would be Gabrielle's son, as it is more common for a son to play chess with his brother. However, it is also possible that Russell is Gabrielle's son-in-law if he is married to Gabrielle's daughter.\n\nStep 6: Consider additional information\nSince the story does not provide any additional information about Gabrielle's daughter or Russell's marital status, we cannot definitively determine the relationship between Russell and Gabrielle based on the given information.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information given, we can infer that Russell is either Gabrielle's son or son-in-law, but we cannot determine the exact relationship without additional information."
