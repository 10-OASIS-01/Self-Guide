Their ideology is based on the belief in the superiority of the white race and the exclusion or oppression of non-white people.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tutsi are an ethnic group in Rwanda and Burundi, and they have historically been the target of discrimination and violence, particularly during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The Tutsi have faced persecution and violence based on their ethnicity.\n\nGiven these ideologies and histories, it is highly unlikely that the Ku Klux Klan would work with the Tutsi. The Klan's beliefs are fundamentally opposed to the rights and equality of the Tutsi people. The Klan's ideology is based on the belief in the superiority of the white race and the exclusion or oppression of non-white people, while the Tutsi have historically been the target of discrimination and violence based on their ethnicity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on their respective ideologies and histories, it is highly unlikely that the Ku Klux Klan would work with the Tutsi. Their beliefs and actions are fundamentally opposed to each other, and any potential collaboration between the two groups would be highly unlikely and morally reprehensible."
