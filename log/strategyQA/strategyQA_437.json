Texas has a warm and temperate climate, suitable for growing watermelons, while Antarctica has a cold and harsh climate, not suitable for growing watermelons.\n\nNext, we can look at the agricultural production data for watermelons in both regions. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Texas is one of the top watermelon-producing states in the US, with a significant amount of watermelon production. On the other hand, Antarctica is not known for any agricultural production, let alone watermelon production, due to its extreme climate and lack of arable land.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that more watermelons are grown in Texas than in Antarctica. The climate and agricultural production data support this conclusion."
