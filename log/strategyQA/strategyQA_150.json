Is the hottest temperature in the Sahara higher than the boiling point of water?\n\nFacts:\n1. The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level.\n2. The Sahara Desert is one of the hottest places on Earth, with temperatures reaching up to 58 degrees Celsius or 136 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAnalysis:\nFirst, let's consider the boiling point of water. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level. This means that under normal atmospheric pressure, water will boil at this temperature.\n\nNext, we need to determine the hottest temperature in the Sahara. The Sahara Desert is known for its extreme heat, with temperatures reaching up to 58 degrees Celsius or 136 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is significantly higher than the boiling point of water.\n\nNow, we need to compare the two temperatures. Is the hottest temperature in the Sahara higher than the boiling point of water? This comparison will help us determine whether the hottest temperature in the Sahara is too cold to boil water.\n\nBy following these reasoning steps and considering the facts about the boiling point of water and the hottest temperature in the Sahara, we can work towards solving the question."

The highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is 58°C (136.4°F) in the town of El Azizia, Libya, on September 13, 1922.\n\nNext, let's consider the boiling point of water. The boiling point of water is 100°C (212°F) at sea level.\n\nNow, let's compare the two temperatures. The hottest temperature in the Sahara, 58°C, is significantly lower than the boiling point of water, 100°C. Therefore, it is not too cold to boil water in the Sahara.\n\nIn conclusion, the hottest temperature in the Sahara is not too cold to boil water. The reasoning process involved comparing the temperature in the Sahara to the boiling point of water and determining that the Sahara's temperature is not too cold for water to boil."
