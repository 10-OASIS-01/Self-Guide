Their main role is to play music, make announcements, and keep the energy up at the event.\n\nOn the other hand, a marriage license issuer is a government official or authorized individual who is responsible for granting marriage licenses to couples who meet the legal requirements for marriage in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nBased on these definitions, it is clear that a disc jockey does not have the authority or responsibility to issue a marriage license. Their role is strictly related to providing entertainment at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no, a disc jockey does not issue a marriage license after playing at a wedding. These are two completely separate roles with different responsibilities and authorities."
