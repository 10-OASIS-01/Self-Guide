The name \"durian\" actually comes from the Malay word \"duri\" which means thorn, and the fruit is named after its spiky outer shell. This can be confirmed by looking at the etymology of the word and understanding its origins in the Malay language.\n\nAdditionally, there is no known connection between the name \"durian\" and anything commonly found on roses. Roses are known for their thorns, but the word \"durian\" specifically comes from the Malay language and is related to the fruit's physical characteristics, not anything related to roses.\n\nIn conclusion, the name \"durian\" is not inspired by something commonly found on roses, but rather comes from the Malay word for thorn, reflecting the fruit's spiky outer shell."
