I would look for any information about what was traditionally placed in the cornerstone when the library was built.\n\nNext, I would look for any recent updates or renovations to the library that may have involved opening the cornerstone. I would search for any news articles or press releases about these updates to see if there is any mention of DVDs being included in the cornerstone.\n\nIf I am unable to find any information through research, I would consider reaching out to the New York Public Library directly to inquire about the contents of the cornerstone. I would ask if they have included DVDs of new events in the cornerstone and if so, what events are included.\n\nBased on the information I gather, I would then use my reasoning to determine whether or not the New York Public Library's cornerstone contains DVDs of new events. If there is evidence to support it, such as official statements from the library or news articles confirming it, then I would conclude that it does. If there is no evidence to support it, then I would conclude that it does not."
