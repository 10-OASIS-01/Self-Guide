Since Copper and Carbon are in different periods, it means they have different numbers of energy levels for their electrons.\n\nCopper has 29 electrons and its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d10 4s1, which means it has electrons in the 3rd and 4th energy levels. On the other hand, Carbon has 6 electrons and its electron configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p2, which means it has electrons in the 1st and 2nd energy levels.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that Copper and Carbon do not belong to the same period on the periodic table."

Copper and Carbon do not belong to the same period on the periodic table.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nVerification:\nThe atomic number of an element determines its position in the periodic table. Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, and the period of an element is determined by the energy level of its outermost electrons. Based on this understanding, it is clear that Copper and Carbon do not belong to the same period on the periodic table. Therefore, the reasoning process is accurate and provides a comprehensive understanding of why Copper and Carbon do not belong to the same period."
