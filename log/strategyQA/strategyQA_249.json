Infants are young children who are not yet able to walk or talk, and they do not have the physical capability to fly on their own. Next, let's address the question of whether infants have wings. In reality, infants do not have wings like birds or insects. Finally, we need to determine if infants can fly.

However, if we were to imagine a scenario where an infant did have wings, we would still need to consider the physical development and strength of the infant.\n\nInfants do not have the muscle strength or coordination to fly, even if they had wings. Their bodies are not developed enough to support the physical demands of flight. Additionally, their cognitive and sensory abilities are not developed enough to navigate and control flight.\n\nFurthermore, the laws of physics also come into play. In order for an organism to fly, it needs to generate enough lift to overcome the force of gravity. Infants, even with wings, would not have the physical capability to generate enough lift to fly.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the physical capabilities and developmental stage of infants, as well as the laws of physics, it is not possible for an infant to fly with wings."
