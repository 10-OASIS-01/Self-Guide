Formula One, as a racing series, was inaugurated in 1950 with the first race taking place at Silverstone, United Kingdom.\n\nNext, we need to determine when YouTube was launched and when it started allowing live broadcasts. YouTube was launched in 2005, and live streaming capabilities were introduced in 2011.\n\nNow, we need to find out when Formula One races started being broadcasted live on YouTube. This would require researching the official Formula One broadcasting partners and their online streaming platforms.\n\nAfter conducting some research, it appears that Formula One races are not typically broadcasted live on YouTube. Instead, they are usually broadcasted on television networks or official Formula One streaming platforms.\n\nBased on this information, it is unlikely that Formula One’s inauguration was broadcasted live on YouTube, as YouTube did not have live streaming capabilities at that time and Formula One races are not commonly broadcasted on the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical timeline of Formula One, the launch of YouTube, and the typical broadcasting methods for Formula One races, it is unlikely that Formula One’s inauguration was broadcasted live on YouTube."

The historical timeline of Formula One's inauguration in 1950 and the launch of YouTube in 2005, along with the typical broadcasting methods for Formula One races, suggest that YouTube was not a platform for live broadcasting of the event. Additionally, while YouTube is a popular platform for live streaming events, there is no direct evidence or widespread acknowledgment that the inauguration was broadcasted on YouTube. Therefore, the inference that Formula One’s inauguration was broadcasted live on YouTube is false."
