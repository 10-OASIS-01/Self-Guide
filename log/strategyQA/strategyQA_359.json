New York City is in the Eastern Time Zone, which is 3 hours ahead of Seattle, which is in the Pacific Time Zone.\n2. The International Date Line is an imaginary line on the Earth's surface, located mostly along the 180th meridian in the Pacific Ocean, and is the line that separates two consecutive calendar days.\n3.

New York City is in the Eastern Time Zone, which is 3 hours ahead of Seattle, which is in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\nWhen it is midnight in New York City, it is only 9 PM in Seattle. This means that it is not possible to celebrate midnight in both cities at the same time.\n\nHowever, it is possible to celebrate midnight in both cities in the same year. For example, if it is December 31st in New York City and it is already past midnight, it is still December 31st in Seattle, and they have not yet reached midnight. Therefore, it is possible to celebrate midnight in both cities in the same year, just not at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not possible to celebrate midnight in New York City and Seattle at the same time due to the time difference, but it is possible to celebrate midnight in both cities in the same year."
