            "content": "First, let's establish who Jeremy Bentham was and what his beliefs were. Jeremy Bentham was a philosopher and jurist who is known for his theory of utilitarianism, which is the idea that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, or happiness, for the greatest number of people. \n\nNow, let's consider the TV show \"Fabulous 30.\" This is a Taiwanese drama series that revolves around the lives of three women who are about to turn 30. The show explores their careers, relationships, and personal growth.\n\nGiven Bentham's utilitarian beliefs, he would likely consider whether \"Fabulous 30\" promotes happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people. He would also consider whether the show aligns with his principles of maximizing utility.\n\nTo determine whether Bentham would think \"Fabulous 30\" is fabulous, we would need to analyze the content of the show and its potential impact on the happiness of the audience. We would also need to consider whether the show promotes values and behaviors that align with Bentham's utilitarian principles.\n\nUltimately, without specific information about the content and impact of \"Fabulous 30,\" it is difficult to definitively say whether Bentham would think the show is fabulous. However, we can use his utilitarian principles to guide our analysis and reasoning process."
