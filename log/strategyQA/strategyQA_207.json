Given the time period in which he lived and worked, it is highly unlikely that he would have studied hip-hop linguistics. Hip-hop as a musical and cultural movement emerged in the 1970s in the Bronx, New York City, and hip-hop linguistics as a field of study would have developed much later.\n\nAdditionally, Olin Levi Warner's primary focus was on sculpture and visual arts, and there is no known evidence to suggest that he had any interest in or connection to the study of linguistics, let alone a specific focus on hip-hop linguistics.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context and Olin Levi Warner's known interests and focus, it is highly unlikely that he would have studied hip-hop linguistics."
