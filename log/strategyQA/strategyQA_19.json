            "content": "The answer to the question is no, Australian rules football is not played with forty-eight people. \n\nFirst, let's consider the basic rules of Australian rules football. The game is played with two teams, each consisting of 18 players on the field at any given time. This means that there are a total of 36 players actively participating in the game.\n\nNext, we need to consider the possibility of additional players on the field. In some cases, there may be up to four interchange players per team who can substitute in and out of the game. However, these interchange players are not on the field at the same time as the 18 active players from each team. Therefore, they do not contribute to the total number of players on the field at any given time.\n\nSo, based on the rules and regulations of Australian rules football, the total number of players on the field at any given time is 36 (18 players per team). There are no additional players on the field, so the total number of players is not forty-eight.\n\nIn conclusion, Australian rules football is not played with forty-eight people. The correct number of players on the field at any given time is 36."
