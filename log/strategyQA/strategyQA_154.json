I would look for reliable sources such as official government websites or historical archives to find accurate information about the coat of arms.\n\nIf I find that there is no mention of a Cowardly Lion on the Flanders coat of arms, I would then consider the possibility that the Cowardly Lion may be a fictional character from literature or popular culture, such as the character from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" In that case, it would not be logical for a fictional character to be included on a real coat of arms.\n\nIf I find that there is indeed a Cowardly Lion on the Flanders coat of arms, I would then consider the significance of this inclusion. I would look into the history and symbolism of the coat of arms to understand why the Cowardly Lion is represented on it.\n\nOverall, my approach to solving this problem would involve thorough research, critical thinking, and logical reasoning to determine whether the Cowardly Lion is on the Flanders coat of arms."
