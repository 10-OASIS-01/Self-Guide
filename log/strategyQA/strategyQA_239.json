The show is set in New York City, so any background scenes would likely feature iconic New York City landmarks.\n\nThe Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, is located in Chicago, Illinois. It is not a landmark that would typically be seen in the background of scenes set in New York City.\n\nAdditionally, the Sears Tower is not typically associated with the types of locations and neighborhoods that are featured in Law and Order, which tend to focus on areas of Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs.\n\nTherefore, based on the setting of Law and Order and the location of the Sears Tower, it is unlikely that the Sears Tower would be seen in the background of the show."
