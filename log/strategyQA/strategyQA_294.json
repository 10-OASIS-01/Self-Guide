This ingredient is gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains. \n\nNext, we need to determine if gluten contains DNA. DNA is a molecule that contains genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms. \n\nGluten is a protein, and proteins are made up of amino acids, not DNA. DNA is found in the nucleus of cells, while gluten is found in the endosperm of the wheat kernel. Therefore, it is unlikely that gluten contains DNA.\n\nIn conclusion, the ingredient in flour that makes it stretchy, gluten, does not contain DNA. This is because gluten is a protein made up of amino acids, not DNA."
