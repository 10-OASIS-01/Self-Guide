Donald Duck, on the other hand, was created by Walt Disney and first appeared in a comic strip in 1934.\n\nBased on this information, it is clear that Felix the Cat beat Donald Duck to the comics by 11 years. Therefore, the answer to the question is no, Donald Duck did not beat Felix the Cat to the comics.\n\nIn conclusion, Felix the Cat appeared in comics before Donald Duck, so he can be considered to have beaten Donald Duck to the comics."
