According to the Bible, Moses was a significant figure in the history of the Israelites and is traditionally credited with writing the first five books of the Bible. \n\nNow, let's look at the genealogy of Moses as described in the Bible. In the Book of Exodus, it is mentioned that Moses' parents were from the tribe of Levi. His father's name was Amram and his mother's name was Jochebed. \n\nThe tribe of Levi was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and they were the priestly tribe. So, it is clear that Moses was from the tribe of Levi.\n\nNow, let's address the specific question of whether Moses was the son of Levi. In a literal sense, Moses was not the son of Levi. Rather, he was a descendant of Levi. This is a common way of referring to someone's lineage in the Bible. For example, when it is said that someone is the \"son of David,\" it means that they are a descendant of David, not necessarily his immediate son.\n\nTherefore, based on the genealogy and the way lineage is described in the Bible, we can conclude that Moses was not the immediate son of Levi, but he was a descendant of Levi."
