Veganism is a lifestyle that seeks to minimize harm to animals and the environment, and many vegans also prioritize social justice and equality. \n\nVladimir Putin, as the president of Russia, has been criticized for his government's human rights abuses, suppression of political opposition, and environmental policies. These actions are likely to be at odds with the values of a vegan co-op, which may prioritize human rights, democracy, and environmental protection.\n\nAdditionally, Putin's support for industries such as the meat and dairy industry, which are often criticized by vegans for their impact on animals and the environment, may further alienate him from the members of a vegan co-op.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, it is unlikely that Vladimir Putin would be popular at a vegan co-op. His policies and actions are likely to be in direct conflict with the values and beliefs of the members of the co-op."
