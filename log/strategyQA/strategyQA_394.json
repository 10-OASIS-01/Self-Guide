Mary Boleyn was the sister of Anne Boleyn, who was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England and the mother of Elizabeth I of England.\n\nThere is no historical evidence to suggest that Mary Boleyn married the father of Elizabeth I of England. Mary Boleyn was married to William Carey, an English courtier, and they had two children together. There is no record of Mary Boleyn being married to King Henry VIII or having any children with him.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical evidence available, it is unlikely that the first female ambassador in European history, Mary Boleyn, married the father of Elizabeth I of England."
