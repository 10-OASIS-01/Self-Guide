I would look for credible sources such as news articles, historical records, or eyewitness accounts.\n\nNext, I would examine the details of the incident. What was the dog's role in saving the soldiers? How did the dog behave during the artillery fire? Were there any documented accounts or evidence supporting the claim that the dog saved the soldiers?\n\nI would also consider any potential biases or exaggerations in the retelling of the story. It's important to critically evaluate the sources and consider the context in which the story is being told.\n\nAdditionally, I would look for any corroborating evidence or testimonies from the soldiers who were allegedly saved by the dog. Their firsthand accounts could provide valuable insight into the dog's actions and its impact on the situation.\n\nBased on the information gathered, I would then weigh the evidence and consider the likelihood of the dog actually saving the soldiers from artillery fire. I would also consider alternative explanations for the soldiers' survival, such as strategic positioning or other factors unrelated to the dog's actions.\n\nUltimately, my conclusion would be based on the preponderance of evidence and the credibility of the sources. If there is sufficient evidence to support the claim that a dog saved soldiers from artillery fire, I would accept it as a plausible scenario. However, if the evidence is lacking or inconclusive, I would remain skeptical of the claim."
