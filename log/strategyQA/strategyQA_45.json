According to the official website of the United States Marine Corps, the maximum age for enlisting is 28 years old. However, there are some exceptions to this age limit for certain individuals with specialized skills or experience.\n\nNext, I would research if there are any specific age waivers or exceptions for individuals over the age of 28 who are interested in joining the Marine Corps. I would look for information on the official website or contact a recruiter for more information.\n\nIf there are no specific age waivers or exceptions for individuals over the age of 28, it is unlikely that a 45-year-old male would be able to join the Marine Corps for the first time. However, if there are exceptions for individuals with specialized skills or experience, I would explore whether the individual in question meets those criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the current age requirements for enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, it is unlikely that a 45-year-old male would be able to join for the first time. However, it is important to thoroughly research and consider any potential exceptions or waivers before making a final determination."
