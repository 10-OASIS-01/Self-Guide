The first Boat Race took place in 1829, which was long after the French Revolution, so it is unlikely that the race was held during that time.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, which occurred between 1789 and 1799, there was significant political and social upheaval in France. This would have made it difficult, if not impossible, for an event like The Boat Race to take place in England, as it would have been overshadowed by the larger political events happening in Europe at the time.\n\nAdditionally, the tradition of The Boat Race is closely tied to the history and culture of the two universities, and it is unlikely that such a tradition would have been established during a time of such turmoil and instability.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical timeline and the context of the French Revolution, it is reasonable to conclude that The Boat Race was not held during that time."
