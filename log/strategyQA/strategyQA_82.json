To solve this problem, we need to gather information about the history of Stanford University and any potential connections to Salmonella infection.\n\nFirst, let's look at the history of Stanford University. Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their son, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at the age of 15. The university was established as a coeducational and non-denominational institution, with a focus on providing a practical education.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential connection to Salmonella infection. Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning and other illnesses in humans. It is typically spread through contaminated food or water. However, there is no widely known connection between Salmonella infection and the founding of Stanford University.\n\nBased on the information available, it does not appear that a Salmonella infection directly contributed to the founding of Stanford University. The university was founded as a result of the tragic death of Leland Stanford Jr. from typhoid fever, not Salmonella infection.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the history of Stanford University and considering the potential connection to Salmonella infection, it does not seem that a Salmonella infection contributed to the founding of the university. The founding of Stanford University was a result of the Stanfords' desire to honor their son and create a lasting legacy in his memory."
