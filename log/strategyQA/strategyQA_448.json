The latitude is the distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees.\n\nThe latitude of the Riksdag, which is located in Stockholm, Sweden, is approximately 59.3293° N.\n\nThe latitude of Quebec City, which is located in Canada, is approximately 46.8139° N.\n\nNow, we can compare the latitudes of the two locations. Since the equator is at 0° latitude, the Riksdag is located at a higher latitude (59.3293° N) compared to Quebec City (46.8139° N). This means that the Riksdag is further north from the equator than Quebec City.\n\nTherefore, the Riksdag is not closer to the equator than Quebec City. In fact, it is further away from the equator."
