According to research, the average lifespan of a wild grizzly bear is around 20-25 years. \n\nNext, let's consider the age at which individuals are typically eligible to vote. In most countries, the voting age is 18 or older.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that wild grizzly bears do not live long enough to be eligible to vote. Their average lifespan of 20-25 years falls short of the minimum voting age of 18.\n\nTherefore, wild grizzly bears do not live long enough to be eligible to vote."
