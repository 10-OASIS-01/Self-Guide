Did Elizabeth I modify the Psalms in Handel's Messiah?\n\nFacts:\n- Handel's Messiah is an oratorio composed by George Frideric Handel in 1741.\n- The Psalms are a collection of religious songs or hymns found in the Bible.\n- Elizabeth I was the Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 until her death in 1603.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The Psalms in Handel's Messiah are a selection of texts from the Book of Psalms in the Bible that Handel set to music for his oratorio.\n2.

Therefore, it is highly unlikely that she could have modified the Psalms in Handel's Messiah.\n\nFurthermore, the Psalms themselves are ancient religious texts, and their content is not known to have been modified by Elizabeth I or anyone else. The Psalms are part of the Old Testament and have been preserved and passed down through religious traditions for centuries.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical timeline and the nature of the Psalms as ancient religious texts, it is highly unlikely that the Psalms in Handel's Messiah were modified by Elizabeth I or anyone else."
