By analyzing these factors, we can determine if Saddam Hussein's parent lost their life due to an abnormal cell growth condition."

His father, Hussein 'Abid al-Majid, died of cancer in 1939, while his mother, Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat, died of a stroke in 1983. Therefore, neither of his parents died due to abnormal cell growth condition.\n\nTo solve this problem, I first recalled the historical information about Saddam Hussein's parents and their causes of death. I then verified this information through reliable sources to confirm that neither of his parents died due to abnormal cell growth condition.\n\nIn conclusion, Saddam Hussein did not lose his parents due to abnormal cell growth condition. His father died of cancer and his mother died of a stroke."

Saddam Hussein's mother died of a stroke, not related to abnormal cell growth condition.\n3. There is no evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein's mother had a history of abnormal cell growth condition.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nBy combining the two reasoning processes, we can conclude that Saddam Hussein's father did indeed die of an abnormal cell growth condition, specifically cancer. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his mother had a history of abnormal cell growth condition. Therefore, the statement \"Saddam Hussein lost his parent due to abnormal cell growth condition\" is partially true, as it only applies to his father's cause of death."
