Hepatitis is a liver disease, so I would look for any yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or loss of appetite in any of the characters.\n\nNext, I would consider any risk factors for hepatitis that the characters may have. These could include a history of intravenous drug use, unprotected sex with multiple partners, or exposure to contaminated blood or body fluids. I would also consider any recent travel to areas with high rates of hepatitis.\n\nThen, I would look for any episodes or storylines in the show that may have addressed hepatitis or liver disease. This could provide clues as to whether any of the characters have been affected by the disease.\n\nFinally, I would consider the overall tone and themes of the show. The Simpsons is a comedy, so it is unlikely that the show would depict a serious illness like hepatitis without addressing it in a comedic or satirical way.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that the Simpsons do not show signs of hepatitis. The show is primarily focused on humor and satire, and there is no evidence to suggest that any of the characters have been affected by the disease."

None of the characters exhibit the symptoms, and there are no storylines or events in the show that suggest any character has contracted hepatitis. Therefore, the conclusion that the Simpsons do not show signs of hepatitis is accurate."
