The IOC is responsible for determining which sports are included in the Olympic Games.\n\nIn this case, the decision to add Women's rowing to the Olympic programme would have been made by the IOC, not by Barack Obama or any other president. The IOC evaluates various factors such as the popularity of the sport, its global participation, and its appeal to audiences when making decisions about adding or removing sports from the Olympic programme.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to attribute the addition of Women's rowing to the Olympic programme to Barack Obama or any other president. It is a decision that falls within the purview of the IOC.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Barack Obama added Women's rowing to the Olympic programme for the first time as a president is not accurate. The decision to include Women's rowing in the Olympic programme would have been made by the IOC, not by any individual president."
