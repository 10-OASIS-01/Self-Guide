How long is a US senator's term?\n\nFacts:\n1. The average lifespan of a lobster is around 50 years.\n2. Lobsters molt and shed their exoskeleton to grow larger. They can molt several times a year when they are young, but as they age, they molt less frequently.\n3. Lobsters have the ability to regenerate lost limbs, and it can take several molts for a new limb to fully grow back.\n4. A US senator's term is 6 years.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The average lifespan of a lobster is around 50 years, so it is possible for a lobster to molt and regrow a lost limb multiple times within a US senator's term.\n2. Since lobsters molt less frequently as they age, it is important to consider the age of the lobster in question when determining if it can regrow a new leg within a senator's term.\n3. It is also important to consider the time it takes for a lobster to regrow a lost limb, as this will impact whether it can regrow a new leg within a senator's term.\n\nGuidance:\nBased on the facts and analysis, we can start by finding out the average lifespan of a lobster and how often they molt. Then, we can determine the time it takes for a lobster to regrow a lost limb. Finally, we can compare this information to the length of a US senator's term to see if a lobster can grow a new leg within that time frame."

            "content": "First, let's consider the lifespan of a lobster. Lobsters can live for several decades, with some estimates suggesting they can live up to 50 years. \n\nNext, let's consider the term length of a US senator. A US senator's term is 6 years.\n\nNow, let's consider the regenerative abilities of lobsters. Lobsters are known to have the ability to regenerate lost limbs, including legs. This process can take several molts to fully regrow a lost limb.\n\nGiven this information, it is possible for a lobster to grow a new leg within one US senator's term. If a lobster were to lose a leg early in a senator's term, it would have the potential to regrow the leg through the process of molting over the course of the 6-year term.\n\nTherefore, based on the lifespan of a lobster, the term length of a US senator, and the regenerative abilities of lobsters, it is reasonable to conclude that a lobster could grow a new leg within one US senator's term."

The average lifespan of a lobster allows for multiple molts and regenerations, and considering the term length of a US senator, it is reasonable to conclude that a lobster could grow a new leg within that time frame. Therefore, the inference that a lobster can grow a new leg in one US senator's term is true."
