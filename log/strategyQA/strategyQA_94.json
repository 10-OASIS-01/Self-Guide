In Judaism, the concept of sin is often based on the teachings of the Torah and the Talmud, as well as the interpretations of rabbis.\n\nPost Malone is a popular American musician known for his rap and hip-hop music. Whether or not he is considered a sinner according to rabbis would likely depend on his actions and how they align with Jewish religious teachings.\n\nTo determine if Post Malone is considered a sinner by rabbis, we would need to consider his behavior and whether it aligns with Jewish religious teachings.
