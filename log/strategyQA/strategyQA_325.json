The question seems to be asking whether Snape, as portrayed by Alan Rickman, killed Dumbledore in the story.\n\nIn the Harry Potter series, Severus Snape does kill Dumbledore, but it is revealed later in the story that Dumbledore had asked Snape to do so in order to protect Draco Malfoy and maintain his cover as a double agent working for Voldemort. This act was part of a larger plan to ultimately defeat Voldemort.\n\nSo, in the context of the Harry Potter story, yes, Snape (as portrayed by Alan Rickman) did kill Dumbledore, but it was not a malicious act. It was a part of a larger plan to ultimately defeat Voldemort and protect the students and staff at Hogwarts.\n\nIn conclusion, Alan Rickman's character, Severus Snape, did kill Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series, but it was a complex and morally ambiguous situation that was ultimately part of a plan to defeat the series' main antagonist, Voldemort."
