Riemann was a German mathematician who made significant contributions to analysis, number theory, and differential geometry.\n\nOne of Riemann's most famous contributions is the development of Riemann integration, which deals with the area under a curve. Riemann integration is a method for defining the integral of a function over an interval by using rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. This is a fundamental concept in calculus and is used to calculate quantities such as area, volume, and work.\n\nGiven Riemann's significant work in the area of integration and the calculation of areas under curves, it is reasonable to conclude that he would indeed work with the area under a curve.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Riemann's contributions to the development of Riemann integration and his work with the area under a curve, it is highly likely that he would work with this concept."
