I would look for any interviews, articles, or quotes from Altman himself or from reliable sources discussing his thoughts on his son's song.\n\nIf I find a source that confirms Altman's opinion on the song, I would then consider the context in which he made the statement. Did he say it in a public interview, in a private conversation, or in a written statement? Understanding the context can help determine the sincerity and significance of his comment.\n\nAdditionally, I would consider the source of the information. Is it a reputable source, such as a well-known publication or a respected journalist? Or is it a less reliable source, such as a tabloid or a social media post? The credibility of the source can impact the validity of the information.\n\nIf I am unable to find a definitive answer, I would consider the possibility that Altman's opinion on the song may not be widely documented or publicly known. In this case, I would not be able to confirm whether he called the song \"Brilliant\" without further evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, to solve the problem of whether Robert Altman called the song his son wrote \"Brilliant,\" I would conduct thorough research, consider the context and credibility of the information, and acknowledge the limitations of available evidence."
