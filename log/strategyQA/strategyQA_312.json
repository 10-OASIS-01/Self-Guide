            "content": "First, let's consider who Pan is. Pan is a Greek god associated with nature, wilderness, and shepherds. He is often depicted as a half-man, half-goat figure playing a flute and is closely connected with the pastoral lifestyle.\n\nNext, let's consider the New Zealand Wool Boom. This refers to a period in the 1950s and 1960s when New Zealand experienced a significant increase in the production and export of wool, leading to economic growth and prosperity for the country.\n\nNow, let's analyze Pan's characteristics and values. As a god of nature and shepherds, Pan would likely have a strong connection to the pastoral lifestyle and the well-being of sheep. He would also value the natural environment and the balance between human activity and nature.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that Pan would likely be a supporter of the New Zealand Wool Boom. The increase in wool production would have meant a thriving pastoral industry, which aligns with Pan's association with shepherds and the pastoral lifestyle. Additionally, the economic prosperity resulting from the wool boom could have been seen as a positive development for the well-being of the people involved in the industry.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Pan's characteristics and values, it is likely that he would have been a supporter of the New Zealand Wool Boom."
