            "content": "First, let's define what traditional watchmakers do. Traditional watchmakers are skilled artisans who design, assemble, and repair mechanical watches by hand. Their work requires precision and attention to detail.\n\nNow, let's consider whether traditional watchmakers would have done lots of menial labor. Menial labor typically refers to low-skilled, repetitive tasks that do not require specialized training or expertise. In the case of traditional watchmakers, their work is highly skilled and requires specialized knowledge and training. They are responsible for intricate tasks such as assembling tiny components, adjusting gears and springs, and ensuring the accuracy of the timepiece. These tasks are far from menial and require a high level of skill and expertise.\n\nAdditionally, traditional watchmaking is considered a craft and an art form, with a long history of craftsmanship and tradition. Watchmakers take pride in their work and often spend years honing their skills to become master craftsmen. This level of dedication and expertise is not typically associated with menial labor.\n\nIn conclusion, traditional watchmakers would not have done lots of menial labor. Their work is highly skilled, specialized, and requires a great deal of expertise and precision. It is a craft that is valued for its artistry and precision, and is far from the low-skilled, repetitive tasks typically associated with menial labor."

This division of labor allowed the master watchmaker to concentrate on the specialized aspects of watchmaking, while the less skilled tasks were handled by assistants. Therefore, the conclusion that traditional watchmakers would have performed some menial labor through delegation is well-supported."
