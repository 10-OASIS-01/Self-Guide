            "content": "First, it's important to consider the laws and regulations regarding marijuana use in the state where the Seahawks are based, which is Washington. In Washington, marijuana use is legal for adults aged 21 and older. However, it is still prohibited to use marijuana in public places.\n\nNext, we need to consider the rules and regulations set by the NFL, the governing body for professional football. The NFL has a strict substance abuse policy, which includes marijuana. Players are subject to random drug testing, and if they test positive for marijuana, they can face disciplinary action, including fines and suspensions.\n\nGiven these factors, it is likely that the Seahawks players are not allowed to smoke pot after their victories, even though it is legal in the state of Washington. The NFL's substance abuse policy takes precedence over state laws, and players are expected to adhere to the league's rules and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, while marijuana use may be legal in the state of Washington, the NFL's substance abuse policy likely prohibits the Seahawks players from smoking pot after their victories. It's important for the players to adhere to the rules set by the league in order to avoid potential disciplinary action."
