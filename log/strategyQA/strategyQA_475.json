In ancient Greece, the oracle of Delphi was a priestess who was believed to be able to communicate with the gods and provide prophetic guidance and advice to those who sought it.\n\nNext, let's consider the properties of tomatoes. Tomatoes are a type of fruit that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, and they have been associated with various health benefits. However, there is no historical or mythological significance of tomatoes in ancient Greek culture or in the context of oracles.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that tomatoes would be helpful to the oracle of Delphi. The oracle's abilities were believed to be supernatural and not influenced by physical objects or substances such as tomatoes. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that tomatoes would have been used in the rituals or practices of the oracle of Delphi.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the role of the oracle of Delphi and the properties of tomatoes, it is unlikely that tomatoes would be helpful to the oracle."
