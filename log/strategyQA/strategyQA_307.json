I would visit their official website and look for information on how they distribute their office software.\n\nIf I find that OpenOffice.org does distribute free office software on CD, I would consider the following:\n- Is this distribution method available in all regions or only in specific countries?\n- Are there any limitations or restrictions on who can receive the free CD?\n- Are there any costs associated with obtaining the CD, such as shipping fees?\n\nIf I find that OpenOffice.org does not distribute free office software on CD, I would consider alternative methods of obtaining the software, such as downloading it from their website or obtaining it through other means.\n\nI would also consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of distributing the software on CD. For example, distributing the software on CD may make it more accessible to individuals without reliable internet access, but it may also incur additional costs for production and shipping.\n\nOverall, my thinking and reasoning process would involve gathering information, considering different factors, and weighing the potential implications of OpenOffice.org's distribution methods."
