The island was settled by the Norse in the 9th century and became part of the Kingdom of the Isles, which was ruled by Norse kings.\n\nWe also know that the Isle of Man was ruled by the Norse Kingdom of Mann and the Isles from the 9th to the 13th century. During this time, the island was under the control of various Norse rulers, including Godred Crovan and his descendants.\n\nAdditionally, the Isle of Man was part of the Kingdom of Norway from the 11th to the 13th century, further solidifying the Scandinavian influence on the island.\n\nBased on this historical evidence, it is clear that the people of the Isle of Man were indeed ruled by someone from Scandinavia in the past. The Norse influence on the island's culture, language, and governance is well-documented and continues to be celebrated today."
