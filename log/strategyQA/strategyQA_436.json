Therefore, it is more likely that the Walt Disney Company uses a variety of catchphrases across its different properties, rather than exclusively using \"D'oh!\"\n\nIn conclusion, based on the understanding of the ownership of \"The Simpsons\" and the diverse range of characters and properties owned by the Walt Disney Company, it is unlikely that the company uses \"D'oh!\" exclusively."
