He created the character of Alice as a young girl who falls into a fantastical world filled with anthropomorphic creatures and nonsensical events.\n\nSince the character of Alice is a product of Lewis Carroll's imagination, she is not part of an extant species. The creatures and characters she encounters in Wonderland, such as the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, and the Queen of Hearts, are also fictional and not part of any real species.\n\nIn conclusion, the Alice in Wonderland character is not based on a member of an extant species, as she is a fictional creation of Lewis Carroll's imagination."
