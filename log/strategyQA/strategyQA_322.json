Jeremy Irons is a real-life actor, while Gilligan is a fictional character from the TV show \"Gilligan's Island.\" Therefore, it is not possible for Jeremy Irons to have landed on the same island as Gilligan in a literal sense.\n\nHowever, if we were to consider a hypothetical scenario where both the real-life Jeremy Irons and the fictional Gilligan were to be on the same island, we would need to consider the timelines and contexts of their respective stories.\n\nJeremy Irons is a contemporary actor, so if we were to imagine him landing on the same island as Gilligan, it would have to be in a fictional or hypothetical context, such as a crossover episode or a work of fiction that brings the two characters together.\n\nIn the context of the TV show \"Gilligan's Island,\" the characters are depicted as being stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean. There is no mention of any other individuals or celebrities landing on the same island in the show's storyline.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available, it can be concluded that Jeremy Irons did not land on the same island as Gilligan in the context of their respective stories."
