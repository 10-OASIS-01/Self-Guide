I would look for images and descriptions of each country's admiral's insignia to understand the specific details and differences between the two.\n\nNext, I would compare the two insignias side by side to identify any similarities and differences. I would pay attention to elements such as colors, symbols, shapes, and any other distinguishing features.\n\nIf the insignias appear similar at first glance, I would then look for more subtle differences that could help distinguish between the two. This might involve examining the placement of specific symbols, the use of different colors or patterns, or any other unique characteristics that set each insignia apart.\n\nAdditionally, I would consider the context in which the insignias are typically worn. For example, if the admiral's insignia is worn on a uniform, I would consider the overall design and color scheme of the uniform to see if it provides additional clues for distinguishing between the Finnish and Portuguese insignias.\n\nFinally, I would consult with experts or individuals familiar with naval insignias to validate my findings and ensure that I have accurately identified the differences between the Finnish and Portuguese admiral's insignia.\n\nThrough this process of analysis and reasoning, I would be able to determine whether it would be difficult to tell the Finnish and Portuguese admiral's insignia apart and identify the specific factors that contribute to their distinguishability."
