They are known to inhabit the coastal areas and pack ice of Antarctica.\n\nNext, let's consider the location of the Equator. The Equator is an imaginary line that circles the Earth, dividing it into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. It is located at 0 degrees latitude.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that Emperor penguins do not dwell near the Equator. In fact, they are found in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically in Antarctica, which is located far from the Equator.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no, Emperor penguins do not dwell near the Equator. Their natural habitat is in the Southern Hemisphere, in the cold and icy regions of Antarctica."
