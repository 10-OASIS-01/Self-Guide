Guam is a small island in the western Pacific Ocean, and it has a tropical climate. \n\nNext, I would consider the climate in Guam. The average temperature in Guam is around 80°F (27°C), and it does not experience snowfall. \n\nBased on this information, I would conclude that skiing is not a popular or common activity in Guam. The climate and geographical location of Guam do not support the presence of snow or ski resorts. Therefore, it is unlikely that people ski in Guam."
