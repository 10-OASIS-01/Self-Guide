Then, I would think about animals that are commonly associated with rebirth. One animal that comes to mind is the phoenix, a mythical bird known for rising from its own ashes and symbolizing rebirth. \n\nNext, I would check if Jackie Chan had a movie in 1973 that was named after a phoenix or had a phoenix theme. If I couldn't recall the specific movie, I would search online for a list of Jackie Chan's movies from 1973 and see if any of them match the criteria.\n\nIf I found a movie that fits the description, I would conclude that the 1973 movie was indeed named for an animal associated with rebirth, in this case, the phoenix. If I couldn't find a movie that fits the criteria, I would conclude that the statement is false.\n\nIn this way, I would use my knowledge of Jackie Chan's movies, animals associated with rebirth, and research skills to solve the problem and come to a conclusion."
