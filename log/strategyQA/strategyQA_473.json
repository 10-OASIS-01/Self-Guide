Bill Nye is a well-known science educator and advocate for environmental protection and action on climate change. He is also a proponent of scientific research and evidence-based decision making. On the other hand, Charles Koch is a billionaire businessman and political donor who has supported conservative and libertarian causes, including skepticism of climate change and environmental regulations.\n\nGiven their differing beliefs and values, it is likely that Bill Nye would disagree with Charles Koch on many issues related to science, the environment, and public policy. Nye's advocacy for climate action and environmental protection would likely put him at odds with Koch's positions on these issues.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that individuals can have complex and multifaceted relationships and interactions. While Nye and Koch may have significant disagreements on certain topics, it's also possible that they could find common ground on other issues or engage in civil discourse and debate.\n\nIn conclusion, based on their public personas and stated beliefs, it is likely that Bill Nye would have significant disagreements with Charles Koch on issues related to science, the environment, and public policy."
