Curling, as we know it today, is a sport that originated in Scotland during the 16th century. \n\nGiven this timeline, it is highly unlikely that King John would have known about curling in the way we understand it today. The sport simply did not exist during his lifetime.\n\nHowever, it is possible that some form of early curling or a similar activity may have been practiced in some form during King John's time, but there is no historical evidence to support this. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical timeline, it is highly unlikely that King John of England would have known about curling as we understand it today."

During King John's reign, international communication and trade were limited compared to modern times, making it unlikely for him to have known about a sport that originated in a different country.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nVerification of reasoning process:\nBy combining the two reasoning processes, we can conclude that it was highly unlikely for King John of England to have known about curling. The sport originated after his reign, and the limited international communication and trade during his time make it improbable for him to have been aware of a sport from a different country. Therefore, the reasoning process supports the conclusion that King John of England would not have known about curling."
