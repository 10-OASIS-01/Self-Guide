The Mexican-American War took place in 1846-1848, while Theodore Roosevelt was born in 1858 and became President in 1901. Therefore, it is historically inaccurate to say that he initiated the war.\n\nThe Mexican-American War was initiated by the United States under President James K. Polk, who sought to expand the country's territory to the Pacific Ocean. The war was a result of territorial disputes between the US and Mexico, particularly over the annexation of Texas and the boundary of the newly acquired territory.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's presidency was known for his foreign policy initiatives, such as the construction of the Panama Canal and the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. However, none of his actions can be attributed to initiating the Mexican-American War.\n\nIn conclusion, Theodore Roosevelt did not initiate the Mexican-American War. It is important to accurately understand historical events and the individuals involved in them."
