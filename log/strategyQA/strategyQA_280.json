King Ramses curse is a reference to an episode of the animated TV show \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" In this episode, the gang encounters the ghost of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, King Ramses, who has placed a curse on anyone who disturbs his resting place.\n\nNow, the question asks if Snoopy, a character from the comic strip \"Peanuts,\" broke King Ramses curse. However, Snoopy is not a character in the \"Scooby-Doo\" universe, so it is not possible for him to have directly interacted with King Ramses or his curse in that context.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that Snoopy did not break King Ramses curse, as there is no evidence or storyline connecting the two characters in any form of media.\n\nIn conclusion, through logical reasoning and analysis of the characters and their respective storylines, it can be determined that Snoopy did not break King Ramses curse."

Additionally, Snoopy being a character from the \"Peanuts\" comic strip and King Ramses being from the \"Scooby-Doo\" universe further supports the conclusion that Snoopy did not break King Ramses curse. Therefore, the inference that Snoopy broke King Ramses curse is false."
