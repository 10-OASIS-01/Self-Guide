Mesopotamia, on the other hand, is a historical region located in Western Asia, mostly within the borders of modern-day Iraq.\n\nBased on this information alone, it is highly unlikely that James IV ruled over Mesopotamia. Scotland and Mesopotamia are geographically and culturally distinct regions, and there is no historical evidence to suggest that James IV had any influence or control over Mesopotamia.\n\nFurthermore, during the time of James IV's reign, Mesopotamia was part of the Ottoman Empire, which was a powerful and independent entity. It is highly unlikely that a Scottish king would have been able to exert any authority over Mesopotamia during this period.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical facts and context, it is safe to say that James IV did not rule over Mesopotamia."
