The chord is called the \"Mafia chord.\"\n\nTo solve this problem, first, I need to identify the crime syndicate that shares its name with a chord. The most well-known crime syndicate is the Mafia, which originated in Italy and has been involved in organized crime activities for many years.\n\nNext, I need to identify a type of chord that shares its name with the Mafia. Upon further research, I found that the \"Mafia chord\" is a term used in music theory to describe a chord that is built on the flattened fifth degree of a scale, also known as a diminished fifth or augmented fourth. This chord is often associated with dissonance and tension in music.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis and reasoning, I can confirm that there is a type of chord that shares its name with a crime syndicate, and that chord is the \"Mafia chord.\""
