However, it is possible that the question is asking if any of the band members are divorced.\n\nTo solve this problem, I would first need to identify the current members of Maroon 5. As of my knowledge, the current members of Maroon 5 are Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden, James Valentine, Matt Flynn, and PJ Morton.\n\nNext, I would need to research the marital status of each member. This information can typically be found through reliable sources such as interviews, public records, or official statements from the band members themselves.\n\nAfter gathering this information, I would be able to determine if any of the members of Maroon 5 are divorced.\n\nIt's important to note that the marital status of the band members is personal information and may not be readily available or easily accessible. Additionally, it's important to respect the privacy of individuals and not make assumptions about their personal lives without verified information."
