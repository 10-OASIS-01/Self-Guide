The question is asking about the likelihood of bankers piercing their tongues. \n\nFirst, we need to consider the typical image and expectations of bankers. Bankers are often seen as professionals who adhere to conservative dress and behavior. They are expected to maintain a certain level of professionalism in their appearance and conduct.\n\nNext, we need to consider the act of piercing one's tongue. Tongue piercings are often associated with a more alternative or non-traditional lifestyle. It is a visible and non-traditional form of body modification.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that bankers are unlikely to pierce their tongues. The conservative nature of the banking profession and the expectations of professionalism would suggest that bankers are less likely to engage in non-traditional forms of body modification.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the typical image and expectations of bankers, it is reasonable to assume that they are unlikely to pierce their tongues."
