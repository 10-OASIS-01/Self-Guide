Instead, the islands are governed by a governor who is elected by the people of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that the Northern Mariana Islands is a self-governing territory with its own constitution and government structure. The governor is the head of the local government and is responsible for the administration of the islands, similar to how a state governor operates in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, as a commonwealth of the United States, the Northern Mariana Islands also has a non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives, who represents the interests of the islands in the U.S. Congress.\n\nTherefore, based on the political structure and governance of the Northern Mariana Islands, it can be concluded that the islands do not have a president, but rather a governor who serves as the head of the local government."
