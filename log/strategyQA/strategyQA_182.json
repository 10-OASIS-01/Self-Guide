I would look for any evidence of hunting or exploitation of the grey whale population by the Dutch in the past.\n\nNext, I would look into the known causes of the extinction of the Atlantic grey whale. This would involve researching factors such as overhunting, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.\n\nI would then compare the historical actions of the Dutch with the known causes of the grey whale's extinction. If there is evidence that the Dutch were involved in overhunting or exploitation of the grey whale population, then it is possible that they contributed to the extinction of the species.\n\nHowever, if there is no evidence of Dutch involvement in the overhunting or exploitation of the grey whale population, then it is unlikely that they played a significant role in the extinction of the species.\n\nIn conclusion, the key to solving this problem would be to gather and analyze historical evidence of Dutch interactions with the Atlantic grey whale population and compare it to the known causes of the species' extinction. This would allow for a reasoned and logical assessment of the Dutch role in the extinction of the Atlantic grey whale."
