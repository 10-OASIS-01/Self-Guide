Samsung phones, on the other hand, use the Android operating system, which is developed by Google.\n\nTo confirm this, you can check the settings on your Samsung phone. Go to the \"About Phone\" section in the settings menu, and you should see information about the operating system being used. It should clearly indicate that the phone is running on Android, not iOS.\n\nAdditionally, you can also look at the interface and features of the operating system on your Samsung phone. iOS and Android have distinct visual styles and user interfaces, so you should be able to tell the difference between the two.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided and the analysis of the operating system on your Samsung phone, it can be confidently stated that Samsung phones do not use iOS as their operating system."

This conclusion is based on the understanding that Samsung phones use the Android operating system, while iOS is specifically designed for Apple devices. Additionally, the differences in user interfaces, app stores, and hardware compatibility further support the conclusion. Therefore, the reasoning process provides a clear and accurate understanding of the operating systems used by Samsung phones and iOS."
