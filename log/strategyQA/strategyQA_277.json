            "content": "First, we need to establish the legal drinking age in Billings, which is typically 21 years old in the United States. If the mayor of Billings is under the age of 21, then they could potentially be arrested for underage drinking if they are caught consuming alcohol.\n\nNext, we need to consider if there are any exceptions or special provisions for the mayor or other public officials in Billings. It's possible that there may be certain legal immunities or privileges that protect the mayor from being arrested for underage drinking while in office.\n\nWe also need to consider the circumstances of the alleged underage drinking. Was the mayor drinking in a public place or at a private residence? Were they driving under the influence? These factors could also impact the likelihood of arrest.\n\nAdditionally, we should look into any past cases or precedents involving public officials and underage drinking in Billings or similar jurisdictions. This can give us insight into how the law is typically applied in these situations.\n\nUltimately, the decision to arrest the mayor for underage drinking would depend on the specific details of the situation, the applicable laws and regulations, and any relevant legal precedents. It's important to approach this issue with a thorough understanding of the legal framework and a careful analysis of the facts."
