However, we can make some educated guesses.\n\nIf Isaac is a visually impaired person, then audiobooks would likely be very helpful to him. They would allow him to access the same information and entertainment as sighted individuals, but in a format that is accessible to him.\n\nIf Isaac is a busy person who doesn't have a lot of time to sit down and read, then audiobooks could also be helpful to him. He could listen to them while commuting, exercising, or doing household chores.\n\nIf Isaac is a struggling reader, then audiobooks could also be helpful to him. They would allow him to access books and other written materials without the frustration and difficulty of trying to read them himself.\n\nOn the other hand, if Isaac is a person who prefers to read and process information visually, then audiobooks might not be helpful to him. He might find it difficult to concentrate on the audio format, or he might simply prefer the experience of reading a physical book.\n\nIn conclusion, whether or not audiobooks would be helpful to Isaac depends on his individual needs, preferences, and circumstances. Without more information about Isaac and his situation, it's impossible to say for sure."
