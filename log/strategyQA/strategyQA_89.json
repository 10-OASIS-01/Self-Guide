VapoRub typically contains ingredients such as eucalyptus, menthol, and camphor, which give it a strong, medicinal scent. These ingredients are not typically found in woodsy notes in perfume.\n\nWoodsy notes in perfume often include scents like cedarwood, sandalwood, and patchouli, which have a warm, earthy, and woody aroma. These scents are not typically found in VapoRub.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is unlikely that VapoRub would bring out woodsy notes in perfume. The scents in VapoRub are quite different from the scents typically associated with woodsy notes in perfume. Therefore, it is unlikely that VapoRub would enhance or bring out the woodsy notes in a perfume.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the ingredients and scents in VapoRub and woodsy notes in perfume, it is unlikely that VapoRub would bring out woodsy notes in perfume."
