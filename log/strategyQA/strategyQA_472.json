            "content": "First, let's break down the question into its components. Homo erectus pekinensis refers to a specific subspecies of Homo erectus, an extinct species of human that lived around 1.8 million to 200,000 years ago. The term \"gospel\" typically refers to the first four books of the New Testament in the Christian Bible, which were written after the time of Homo erectus pekinensis.\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that Homo erectus pekinensis read the gospel as it was not written during their time period. The New Testament was written much later, during the 1st century AD, while Homo erectus pekinensis existed hundreds of thousands of years earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the cognitive abilities and cultural practices of Homo erectus pekinensis are not well understood, but it is generally believed that their cognitive abilities were not advanced enough to comprehend complex religious texts such as the gospel.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and understanding of the time periods involved, it is reasonable to conclude that Homo erectus pekinensis did not read the gospel."
