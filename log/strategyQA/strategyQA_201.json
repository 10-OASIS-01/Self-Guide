The human skull is composed of several bones, including the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital bones, which are fused together to form a protective structure around the brain.\n2. When a bullet impacts a solid object, it transfers its kinetic energy to the object, causing damage and potentially penetrating the object.\n3.

            "content": "First, let's consider the composition and strength of the human skull. The skull is made up of several bones, including the frontal bone, parietal bones, temporal bones, and occipital bone. These bones are fused together and form a hard, protective structure around the brain.\n\nNext, we need to consider the velocity and force of a bullet. Bullets travel at high speeds and carry a significant amount of kinetic energy. When a bullet impacts a surface, it transfers its energy, causing damage to the material it hits.\n\nGiven these factors, it is possible for the human skull to stop a bullet, depending on the type of bullet and the angle at which it strikes the skull. A small, low-velocity bullet may be stopped or deflected by the skull, especially if it hits at a glancing angle. However, a high-velocity or armor-piercing bullet is more likely to penetrate the skull and cause serious injury or death.\n\nIn conclusion, while the human skull is a strong and protective structure, it is not guaranteed to stop a bullet in all circumstances. The outcome would depend on the specific characteristics of the bullet and the force with which it impacts the skull."
