He is a peanut with a top hat, monocle, and cane. \n\nSaturday Night Live is a popular television show known for its comedy sketches and musical performances. \n\nNow, let's analyze the claim that Mr. Peanut composed the music for Saturday Night Live. \n\nBased on what we know about Mr. Peanut, he is a fictional character and not a real person. As a fictional character, he does not have the ability to compose music or participate in real-world activities. \n\nAdditionally, Saturday Night Live has a team of professional musicians and composers who create the music for the show. It is unlikely that a fictional character like Mr. Peanut would be involved in this process. \n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Peanut did not compose the music for Saturday Night Live. This claim is likely a misconception or a joke, rather than a factual statement."
