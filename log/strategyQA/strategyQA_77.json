This means that Anne Frank could not have read Spider-Man comics during her lifetime.\n\nAdditionally, Anne Frank lived in Amsterdam during the time of the Holocaust, and her family was in hiding for two years. During this time, she had limited access to the outside world and was focused on survival and writing in her diary.\n\nGiven these facts, it is highly unlikely that Anne Frank read Spider-Man comics. The historical timeline and the circumstances of her life do not align with the availability or likelihood of her reading such material."
