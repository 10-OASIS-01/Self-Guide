I would look for reliable sources such as scientific journals, news articles from reputable sources, and reports from wildlife organizations.\n\nNext, I would consider the potential ways in which big cats could be exposed to the Zika virus. This could include being bitten by infected mosquitoes, coming into contact with infected animals, or being exposed to the virus through contaminated food or water sources.\n\nI would also consider the potential impact of Zika virus on big cats. This could include symptoms of the virus, potential transmission to other animals or humans, and any known cases of Zika virus affecting big cat populations in the wild or in captivity.\n\nAdditionally, I would look into any research or studies that have been conducted on the topic. This could provide valuable insights into the potential for big cats to be infected with the Zika virus and the implications of such infections.\n\nBased on the information gathered, I would then form a conclusion about whether or not big cats can be infected with the Zika virus. I would consider the evidence, potential risk factors, and any known cases of Zika virus affecting big cats to make an informed assessment.\n\nFinally, I would consider the implications of my findings and any potential actions that could be taken to prevent or address Zika virus infections in big cat populations. This could include measures to reduce exposure to infected mosquitoes, monitoring and surveillance efforts, and potential interventions to protect big cats from Zika virus infections."

While there may not be extensive documented cases of Zika virus infecting big cats, the known hosts of the virus and the susceptibility of big cats to other diseases and viruses suggest that they could be affected by the Zika virus. Therefore, the answer is true."
