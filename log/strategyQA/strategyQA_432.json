There is no evidence or indication that he had any association with Cookie Crisp cereal, as it was not created until many years after his death.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to consider that Pavlov's research focused on the relationship between stimuli and responses in animals, particularly in the context of digestion and salivation. His famous experiments involved ringing a bell before presenting food to dogs, eventually leading the dogs to salivate at the sound of the bell alone, even without the presence of food.\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that Ivan Pavlov had any connection to or opinion about the taste of Cookie Crisp cereal. His work and research were focused on the physiological and psychological responses of animals to specific stimuli, rather than on his personal preferences for specific foods.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information available, there is no reason to believe that Ivan Pavlov had any particular love or dislike for the taste of Cookie Crisp cereal. His work and legacy are centered around his scientific contributions to the understanding of classical conditioning and animal behavior."
