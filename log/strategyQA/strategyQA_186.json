The order Carnivora includes mammals such as cats, dogs, bears, and raccoons, which are all carnivorous animals.\n\nNow, let's think about the characters in Tom and Jerry. Tom is a cat and Jerry is a mouse. Cats are indeed members of the order Carnivora, as they are obligate carnivores and primarily eat meat. Therefore, Tom, being a cat, is a member of the order Carnivora.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, Tom from Tom and Jerry is a member of the order Carnivora. This is because he is a cat, and cats are part of the order Carnivora."
