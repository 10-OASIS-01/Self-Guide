Hyenas live in clans, which are led by a dominant female. This fact suggests that the leadership of the pack is typically held by a female, not a male.\n\nNext, we need to understand the role of males in hyena packs. Males in hyena clans are typically subordinate to the females. This indicates that males do not hold a dominant leadership position within the pack.\n\nWe also need to consider whether hyena males are dominant over females in the pack. In hyena clans, the dominant female holds the leadership position, and males do not have a clear dominance hierarchy within the pack. This further supports the idea that hyena males are not pack leaders.\n\nFinally, we should explore how hyena males establish their leadership within the pack. However, based on the facts provided, it is unlikely that hyena males play a dominant leadership role within the pack.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the social structures of hyenas and the roles of males within the pack, it is unlikely that hyena males are pack leaders."

The females are typically larger and more aggressive than the males.\n\nIn terms of pack leadership, it is the females who are the leaders of the clan, not the males. The dominant female, also known as the matriarch, holds the highest rank in the clan and makes the majority of the decisions for the group. The males in the clan are subordinate to the females and do not hold leadership positions.\n\nTherefore, based on the social structure of hyenas, it can be concluded that hyena males are not pack leaders. The pack leadership role is held by the dominant female, while the males play a subordinate role within the clan."
