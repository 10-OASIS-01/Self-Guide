It was a significant event in financial history and had a major impact on global markets. However, the occurrence of Black Monday is not an annual event.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to understand that Black Monday was a specific event that happened on a particular date in 1987. It was not a recurring event that happens every year. It was a unique and significant event in financial history.\n\nWhile there have been other market crashes and significant events in financial markets since 1987, they have not been referred to as Black Monday. Each event has its own unique circumstances and causes.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Black Monday does not happen every year. It was a one-time event that occurred in 1987 and has not been repeated annually."
