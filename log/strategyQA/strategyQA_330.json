He is often depicted as a powerful and vengeful deity.\n\nNext, let's consider the concept of murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of another person with intent. It is a violent and tragic act that results in the loss of life.\n\nNow, let's think about whether there are any myths or stories in which Poseidon is involved in a murder. While Poseidon is known for his temper and his ability to cause destruction, there is no specific myth or story in which he is directly involved in committing a murder.\n\nBased on this analysis, it does not seem that Poseidon has shown what it is like to be murdered. Instead, he is more commonly associated with causing destruction and chaos through natural disasters and his own actions.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information available from Greek mythology, there is no evidence to suggest that Poseidon has shown what it is like to be murdered. His role in mythology is more closely tied to his powers over the sea and his interactions with other gods and mortals."
