Are there any surveys or studies that have been conducted to determine the number of adults who witnessed the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA?\n\nFacts:\n1. The 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA occurred during the daytime.\n2. There were numerous publicized events and gatherings for the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA, such as viewing parties and organized trips to areas of totality.\n3. There have been surveys and studies conducted to determine the number of people who witnessed the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA.\n\nAnalysis:\nTo answer the question of whether any adult witnessed the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA, we can start by considering the timing of the eclipses. Since both events occurred during the daytime, it is likely that adults were awake and outdoors, making it possible for them to witness the eclipses.\n\nNext, we can consider the publicized events and gatherings that took place for the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA. These events were widely promoted and attracted large numbers of people, including adults. It is reasonable to assume that many adults attended these events and witnessed the eclipses.\n\nFinally, we can look at the surveys and studies that have been conducted to determine the number of people who witnessed the eclipses. These sources can provide data on the demographics of eclipse viewers, including the number of adults who were present.\n\nBy considering these factors, we can begin to form a reasoned analysis of whether any adult witnessed the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA."

Consider the average age of an adult in 2017 and the current year.\n3. Analyze the likelihood of an adult witnessing both eclipses.\n\nStep 1: The 2017 eclipse occurred on August 21, 2017, and the last eclipse seen all across the USA was the same eclipse.\n\nStep 2: The average age of an adult in 2017 would have been around 30-40 years old, and the current year is 2022. This means that adults who were between 35 and 45 years old in 2017 would be between 40 and 50 years old in 2022.\n\nStep 3: Given the average age range of adults who witnessed the 2017 eclipse, it is likely that some adults would have witnessed both the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA. However, it is also possible that some adults may have missed the 2017 eclipse due to various reasons such as location, work commitments, or lack of interest in astronomical events.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible that some adults witnessed both the 2017 eclipse and the last eclipse seen all across the USA, but it is not guaranteed for all adults."
