It later moved to Arundel House before finally settling in its current location on Carlton House Terrace.\n\nSt James's Palace, on the other hand, has been a residence of the monarch and the royal court since the 16th century. It has never been associated with the Royal Society.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it is clear that the Royal Society was never a part of St James's Palace."
