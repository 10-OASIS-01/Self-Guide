The candidates were Woodrow Wilson for the Democratic Party, Theodore Roosevelt for the Progressive Party, William Howard Taft for the Republican Party, and Eugene V. Debs for the Socialist Party.\n\nNext, we need to determine if any of these candidates embraced Ku Klux Klan ideology. The Ku Klux Klan was a white supremacist organization that promoted racism and violence against African Americans, as well as other minority groups.\n\nWoodrow Wilson, who won the 1912 election, has been criticized for his support of racial segregation and his screening of the film \"The Birth of a Nation,\" which glorified the Ku Klux Klan. However, it is important to note that Wilson's views on race were complex and have been the subject of much historical debate.\n\nThe other candidates, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Eugene V. Debs, did not openly embrace Ku Klux Klan ideology.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is not accurate to say that the 1912 United presidential election resulted in a president who openly embraced Ku Klux Klan ideology. However, there are valid criticisms of Woodrow Wilson's views on race and his actions as president."
