Jules Verne was a French novelist known for his adventure and science fiction novels, such as \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" These novels were groundbreaking in their use of technology and exploration of the unknown, but they did not involve aliens or the type of extraterrestrial creatures found in the Aliens series.\n\nThe Aliens series, on the other hand, was created by filmmaker Ridley Scott and first appeared in the 1979 film \"Alien.\" The series features a fictional universe in which humans encounter a hostile and deadly extraterrestrial species known as the Xenomorphs. The series has since expanded to include sequels, prequels, and spin-off media, but Jules Verne had no involvement in its creation.\n\nIn conclusion, Jules Verne did not develop the Aliens series. The two are distinct works of fiction created by different individuals in different time periods, with different themes and subject matter."
