The Moscow Kremlin is located in Moscow, Russia, while the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. These two cities are in different countries and are quite far apart geographically.\n\nNext, let's consider the distance between the two landmarks. The distance between Moscow and Paris is approximately 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles). This distance is quite significant and would require significant travel time, whether by air, train, or car.\n\nAdditionally, we can consider the cultural and historical context. The Moscow Kremlin is a symbol of Russian political power and history, while the Eiffel Tower is a symbol of French culture and engineering. These landmarks are significant to their respective countries and are not typically associated with each other in terms of proximity or cultural significance.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the geographical distance, cultural context, and historical significance, it is clear that the Moscow Kremlin is not near the Eiffel Tower."
