The statue of Zeus was a giant seated figure, made by the Greek sculptor Phidias, and was housed in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia in ancient Greece.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the Panthéon in Paris did not house the statue of Zeus. The Panthéon was not built to house ancient Greek statues, and the statue of Zeus was located in a completely different place and time period.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning process, it can be concluded that the Panthéon did not house the statue of Zeus."
