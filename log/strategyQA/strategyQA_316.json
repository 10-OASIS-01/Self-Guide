I would also look into any common practices or recommendations from handball organizations or experienced players.\n\nIf there are no specific rules or guidelines, I would then consider the nature of the sport and the potential risks for male goalkeepers. Handball is a fast-paced and physical game, with the ball being thrown at high speeds. This could pose a risk for injury to the testes and penis, especially for goalkeepers who are in a position to block shots with their bodies.\n\nBased on this assessment, I would then consider the common practices in other similar sports, such as soccer or hockey, where male athletes often wear protective cups or undergarments for added safety.\n\nUltimately, I would conclude that it is likely a good idea for handball male goalkeepers to wear some form of protective undergarment for the testes and penis, even if it is not explicitly required by the rules. This would help to minimize the risk of injury and ensure the safety and well-being of the players."
