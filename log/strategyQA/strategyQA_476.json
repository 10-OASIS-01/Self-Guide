They are not native to Europe or the United Kingdom.\n\nNext, I would look at the specific location in question, Oxfordshire. Oxfordshire is a county in South East England, known for its rolling hills, farmland, and historic university city of Oxford. It does not have the type of habitat that would support a population of wild lions.\n\nAdditionally, I would consider any known wildlife populations in the area. There are no reports or evidence of wild lion populations in Oxfordshire or anywhere else in the UK.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is safe to conclude that lions do not live in Oxfordshire. Their natural habitat is in Africa, and there are no known wild populations in the UK."

Their natural habitat is in Africa, and the geographical and environmental factors in Oxfordshire do not support a lion population. Therefore, it is true that lions do not live in Oxfordshire."
