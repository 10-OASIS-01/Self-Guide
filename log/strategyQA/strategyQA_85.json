The telegraph was first developed in the early 19th century, with the first practical electric telegraph being patented by Samuel Morse in 1837. \n\nNow, let's consider Benjamin Franklin's contributions and inventions. Benjamin Franklin was a renowned inventor and scientist, known for his experiments with electricity and lightning. He is credited with the invention of the lightning rod and the Franklin stove, among other things. \n\nHowever, there is no historical evidence to suggest that Benjamin Franklin invented the telegraph. His work with electricity laid the groundwork for later developments in electrical communication, but the invention of the telegraph is generally attributed to Samuel Morse and his collaborators.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical timeline and the known contributions of Benjamin Franklin, it is unlikely that he invented the telegraph. The credit for the invention of the telegraph belongs to Samuel Morse."
