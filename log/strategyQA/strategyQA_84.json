Solomon, on the other hand, is a figure known for his wisdom and leadership in the Bible.\n\nGiven the nature of the Daily Stormer, it is highly unlikely that they would cite Solomon as an example of good leadership. The values and beliefs promoted by the Daily Stormer are in direct opposition to the principles of wisdom, justice, and compassion that Solomon is known for.\n\nFurthermore, the Daily Stormer's ideology is rooted in racism and hatred, while Solomon is known for his wisdom and fair judgment. It is unlikely that the Daily Stormer would endorse someone who represents the opposite of their extremist views.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the stark contrast between the values of the Daily Stormer and the principles embodied by Solomon, it is highly unlikely that the Daily Stormer would cite Solomon as an example of good leadership."
