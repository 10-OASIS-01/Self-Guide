I would look for any historical records, archaeological findings, or documented evidence of runestones in the area.\n\nIf I find that there are no known runestones in Orange County, I would then consider the reasons why this might be the case. One possibility is that the area may not have had a significant Norse or Viking presence in the past, as runestones are typically associated with Norse culture.\n\nI would also consider the geological and historical context of the area. Runestones are typically made of stone and can withstand the test of time, so I would consider whether the local geology is suitable for the preservation of such artifacts. Additionally, I would look into the history of settlement and colonization in Orange County to see if there were any potential opportunities for runestones to have been brought to the area in the past.\n\nIf I find evidence of runestones in Orange County, I would then consider the authenticity and provenance of the artifacts. I would look for any scholarly research or archaeological studies that have been conducted on the runestones to verify their legitimacy.\n\nOverall, my approach to solving this problem would involve thorough research, critical thinking, and consideration of historical and geological factors to determine whether Orange County, California has runestones."
