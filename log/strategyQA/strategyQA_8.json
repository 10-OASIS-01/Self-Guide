One such location is Atlanta, Georgia, which was a major transportation hub for the Confederacy during the Civil War and was famously captured by Union forces under the command of General William T. Sherman.\n\nNow, we need to determine if either of the founders of Wiki were born in Atlanta, Georgia. After researching, it is found that neither Jimmy Wales nor Larry Sanger were born in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available, it does not appear that one of Wiki's founders was born where a main transportation hub was overtaken during the Civil War."
