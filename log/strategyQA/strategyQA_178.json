They have a family-friendly image and are known for their wide selection of toys for kids.\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that Toys \"R\" Us sells adult toys. Their brand and target market are focused on children and families, so it would be out of line with their image and values to sell adult toys.\n\nAdditionally, most jurisdictions have strict regulations and laws regarding the sale of adult toys, and it is unlikely that a mainstream retailer like Toys \"R\" Us would want to navigate the legal and ethical complexities of selling such items.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the brand image, target market, and legal considerations, it is highly unlikely that Toys \"R\" Us sells adult toys."
