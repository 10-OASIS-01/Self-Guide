He studied at a vocational school in Lyubertsy, near Moscow, where he also joined a local flying club. \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Gagarin studied near the Ural River. The Ural River is located in the Ural Mountains, which is quite far from Gagarin's hometown and the areas where he is known to have studied and trained.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it is unlikely that Yuri Gagarin studied near the Ural River."
