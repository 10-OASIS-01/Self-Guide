The WWE Raw is a professional wrestling show. \n\nFirst, I would consider the nature of Conor McGregor's career. He has primarily been involved in mixed martial arts and has not participated in professional wrestling in the past. \n\nNext, I would consider the likelihood of McGregor transitioning to professional wrestling. While it is not impossible for a professional athlete to cross over into a different sport, it is important to note that McGregor has not expressed any public interest in pursuing a career in professional wrestling.\n\nAdditionally, I would consider the potential impact of McGregor's involvement in WWE Raw. Given his high profile and popularity, it is possible that his participation could generate significant interest and attention for the WWE. However, without any indication from McGregor or the WWE, it is purely speculative at this point.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is unlikely that Conor McGregor currently fights in the WWE Raw. His career has been focused on mixed martial arts, and there is no public indication of his involvement in professional wrestling."
