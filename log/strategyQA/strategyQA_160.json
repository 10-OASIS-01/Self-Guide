The Romani people, also known as Roma, have a diverse range of religious and cultural beliefs. While some may identify with Christianity, Islam, or other religions, others may practice traditional Romani spirituality. \n\nIt's important to note that Adolf Hitler was responsible for the genocide of an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million Romani people during the Holocaust. This historical fact makes it highly unlikely that the Romani people as a whole would worship or hold any positive views of Hitler.\n\nIn fact, the Romani people have historically been persecuted and marginalized, and it would be illogical for them to worship someone who was responsible for such atrocities against their community.\n\nTherefore, based on historical context and reasoning, it is highly unlikely that the Romani people worship Adolf Hitler. It is important to approach such questions with sensitivity and an understanding of the complexities of different cultural and historical contexts."
