They were known for their distinctive uniforms and often served as a reconnaissance and scouting force.\n\nThe Canadian Friends Service Committee is a peace and social justice organization founded by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). They are known for their commitment to nonviolence, social justice, and humanitarian work.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that hussars would fit in with the Canadian Friends Service Committee. The hussars' historical role as a military cavalry unit does not align with the principles of nonviolence and peace that the Committee upholds. Additionally, their association with military activities may not be in line with the Committee's focus on humanitarian work.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the principles and values of the Canadian Friends Service Committee, it is unlikely that hussars would fit in with the organization. Their historical role as a military cavalry unit and their association with military activities may not align with the Committee's mission and values."
