            "content": "The Heian period in Japan, which lasted from the late 8th century to the late 12th century, was known for its flourishing literary culture. During this time, the court was indeed a central setting for literature, and it was not unusual for Heian literature to be set in courts.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the context of the Heian period. The Heian period was characterized by a highly refined court culture, with the imperial court in Kyoto serving as the center of political, social, and cultural life. It was during this time that many of the classic works of Japanese literature, such as \"The Tale of Genji\" by Murasaki Shikibu and \"The Pillow Book\" by Sei Shonagon, were written.\n\nThese works often depicted the lives and experiences of courtiers and aristocrats, and they were heavily influenced by the courtly culture of the time. The court was not only a physical setting for these works, but also a source of inspiration and a reflection of the values and aesthetics of the Heian period.\n\nAdditionally, the court was a place of power and influence, and the literature of the time often reflected the political and social dynamics of the court. Courtly romance, political intrigue, and the complexities of court life were common themes in Heian literature, further emphasizing the significance of the court as a setting.\n\nIn conclusion, courts were not an unusual setting for Heian literature; in fact, they were a central and integral setting for many of the most important works of the period. The literature of the Heian period was deeply intertwined with court culture and courtly life, and the court served as a rich and complex backdrop for the literary works of the time."
