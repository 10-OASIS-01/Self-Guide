The theme song for Family Guy is a jazzy and upbeat tune with humorous lyrics, which is not characteristic of Beethoven's classical compositions. Beethoven was known for his symphonies and piano sonatas, which are quite different from the style of the Family Guy theme song. Additionally, Beethoven lived in a time before television existed, so he did not write music specifically for television shows. Therefore, it is unlikely that Beethoven wrote the theme song for Family Guy. However, we should also consider if there is any evidence or information linking Beethoven to the theme song for Family Guy before making a final conclusion."

Family Guy is a modern animated television show that premiered in 1999. \n\nSecondly, the theme song for Family Guy was composed by Walter Murphy, an American composer, musician, and arranger. The theme song is a jazzy, big band-style piece that is not characteristic of Beethoven's style of music.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical timeline and the style of music, it is clear that Beethoven did not write the theme song for Family Guy."
