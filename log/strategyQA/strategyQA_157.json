The Statue of Unity is a colossal statue of Indian statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India. It is located in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nNext, I would research the State of Mexico to understand its role in the construction of the Statue of Unity. The State of Mexico is a state in central Mexico and is not directly related to the construction of the Statue of Unity.\n\nBased on this information, it is clear that the State of Mexico did not build the Statue of Unity. The statue was built in the state of Gujarat, India, and is a symbol of Indian independence and unity. Therefore, the State of Mexico did not have any involvement in the construction of the Statue of Unity.\n\nIn conclusion, through research and reasoning, it can be determined that the State of Mexico did not build the Statue of Unity."
