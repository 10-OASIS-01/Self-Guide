Can the soccer team share the lobster's legs evenly?\n   - To determine if the soccer team can share the lobster's legs evenly, we need to see if the total number of lobster legs (10) can be divided equally among the players on the soccer team (22 legs).\n   - We can guide the students to think about whether 10 can be divided equally among 22, and if not, what the remainder would be.\n\nBy following this reasoning process, the students can work through the problem step by step and come to a conclusion about whether a soccer team can share one lobster's legs evenly."

A lobster has 10 legs, so if we divide that by the number of players on a soccer team, we can determine if they can share the legs evenly.\n\nLet's assume a standard soccer team has 11 players. If we divide 10 legs by 11 players, each player would get 0.909 legs, which is not possible. \n\nEven if we round down to 0 legs per player, there would still be one leg left over, which cannot be evenly distributed among the players.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for a soccer team to share one lobster's legs evenly."

The total number of legs on a soccer team is 22 (11 players x 2 legs each).\n\nAnswer: False\n\nCombining the reasoning processes, we can see that a lobster has 10 legs, and a soccer team has 22 legs in total. When we divide 10 legs by 22 players, we find that each player would get approximately 0.45 legs, which is not possible. Therefore, it is not possible for a soccer team to share one lobster's legs evenly."
