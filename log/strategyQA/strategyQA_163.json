They are typically about 5mm in diameter and are dark brown or black in color.\n\nMangoes, on the other hand, are large, oval-shaped fruits with a smooth outer skin. The seeds inside a mango are flat and large, with a distinct elongated shape.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that black pepper seeds are not similar in form to mangoes. The size, shape, texture, and color of the two are quite different.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no, black pepper seeds are not similar in form to mangoes."
