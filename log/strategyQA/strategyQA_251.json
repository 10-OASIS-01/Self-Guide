A fletcher is a person who makes and sells arrows, while Apollo is the Greek god of archery, among other things.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential affinity between a fletcher and Apollo. The fletcher's profession is directly related to archery, which is a skill associated with Apollo. In Greek mythology, Apollo is often depicted with a bow and arrows, and he is considered the patron god of archery. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a fletcher might have an affinity for Apollo due to their shared connection to archery.\n\nAdditionally, many craftsmen and artisans in ancient Greece would often pay homage to the gods associated with their craft. It was believed that the gods would inspire and guide them in their work. As such, it is not uncommon for a fletcher to have a reverence for Apollo and seek his favor in their craft.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the close association between the fletcher's profession and Apollo's domain as the god of archery, it is reasonable to believe that a fletcher might have an affinity for Apollo. This affinity could stem from a shared connection to the craft of archery and a desire for divine inspiration and guidance in their work."
