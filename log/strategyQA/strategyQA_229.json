Near was a publisher who was involved in a landmark Supreme Court case, Near v. Minnesota, in 1931. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that prior restraints on publication, or censorship, were unconstitutional.\n\nGiven the mission of Reporters Without Borders, it is likely that they would have supported Jay M. Near in his fight against censorship. The organization's advocacy for freedom of the press aligns with Near's legal battle to publish without prior restraint.\n\nFurthermore, Reporters Without Borders has a history of supporting journalists and publishers who face censorship or legal challenges in their work. They have spoken out against government censorship and have provided support to journalists facing persecution for their reporting.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the mission and actions of Reporters Without Borders, it is reasonable to assume that they would have fought against the censorship that Jay M. Near faced in his legal battle. Their advocacy for freedom of the press and protection of journalists aligns with the principles at stake in Near v. Minnesota."
