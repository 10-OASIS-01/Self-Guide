Break down the essay into smaller tasks, such as brainstorming, outlining, writing the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Set specific time limits for each task to ensure that you make steady progress.\n\nIn terms of research, you may not have access to the internet or reference materials on the bus. In this case, rely on your own knowledge and experiences to support your argument. Draw from personal anecdotes, observations, or general knowledge to provide examples and evidence for your points.\n\nOverall, the key to finishing an SAT practice essay on a bus ride from Seattle to Vancouver is to stay focused, manage your time effectively, and make the most of the resources available to you.
