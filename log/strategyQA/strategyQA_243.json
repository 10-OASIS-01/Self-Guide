Comic books first gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s, with the introduction of iconic characters like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. These early comic books were printed on paper and distributed in physical form.\n\nNow, let's consider the history of video format. Video format, as we understand it today, refers to the recording and playback of moving images and sound. The technology for video format did not become widely available until the mid-20th century, with the introduction of television and later, home video recording devices.\n\nGiven this timeline, it is clear that the first modern comic books did not come out in video format. They were produced and distributed as printed material before the technology for video format was widely available.\n\nIn conclusion, the first modern comic books did not come out in video format. They were printed on paper and distributed in physical form before the technology for video format became widely available."
