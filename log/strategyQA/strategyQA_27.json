The Secretary of State is not a military leader and does not have the authority to declare war or engage in military action on their own.\n\nThe power to declare war and engage in military action is granted to the President of the United States by the Constitution. The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the military and has the authority to make decisions regarding the use of military force. The Secretary of State may advise the President on foreign policy matters and may be involved in diplomatic efforts to prevent or resolve conflicts, but they do not have the authority to initiate or conduct military operations.\n\nIn summary, the United States Secretary of State does not have the power to go to war.
