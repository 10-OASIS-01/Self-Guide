Bestiality is the act of engaging in sexual activity with an animal, while cousin marriage is the marriage between cousins.\n\nNext, we need to determine the legality of these acts in the United States. Bestiality is universally illegal in the United States, as it is considered animal cruelty and is prohibited by laws in all 50 states. On the other hand, cousin marriage laws vary by state. Some states allow cousin marriage, while others prohibit it or allow it under certain circumstances.\n\nTo compare the universality of the legality of these acts, we can look at the number of states where each act is legal. Since bestiality is universally illegal in all 50 states, it is more universally illegal than cousin marriage, which is legal in some states.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, bestiality is more universally illegal than cousin marriage in the United States."
