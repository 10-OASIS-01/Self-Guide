Shaq is known for his basketball skills, so his side gig could be related to basketball, such as coaching or playing in exhibition games.\n\nNext, we need to consider what Ancient Greece was like. Ancient Greece was a civilization that existed from around 800 BC to 146 BC, and it was known for its advancements in philosophy, art, and athletics, including the Olympic Games.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that Shaq would be able to continue his side gig in Ancient Greece. Basketball as we know it did not exist in Ancient Greece, and the closest sport to basketball at that time would have been a game called \"episkyros,\" which involved throwing a ball back and forth between teams, but it was quite different from modern basketball.\n\nAdditionally, the rules and regulations of sports in Ancient Greece were very different from those of modern sports. The Olympic Games, for example, were a religious and athletic festival held in honor of Zeus, and the events included running, jumping, discus and javelin throwing, wrestling, and chariot racing. There were no team sports like basketball.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that Shaq would be able to continue his side gig in Ancient Greece, as the sport of basketball did not exist and the athletic culture was very different from modern times."
