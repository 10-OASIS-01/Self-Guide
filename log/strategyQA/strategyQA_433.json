Hamilton is approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes long.\n2. Thanksgiving dinner typically takes 2-4 hours to cook, depending on the dishes being prepared.\n\nAnalysis:\nFirst, let's consider the length of Hamilton. It is approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes long. Next, we need to determine how long it takes to cook Thanksgiving dinner. This can vary depending on the dishes being prepared, but typically it takes 2-4 hours. Now, we need to compare the length of Hamilton to the time it takes to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Based on the facts, we can then determine if it is feasible to watch Hamilton while Thanksgiving dinner cooks.\n\nNow, let's consider the first step. How long is Hamilton? This is important to know in order to compare it to the time it takes to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Can you find out how long Hamilton is?"

The musical has a runtime of about 2 hours and 40 minutes. \n\nNext, let's consider the typical cooking time for a Thanksgiving dinner. This can vary depending on the dishes being prepared, but a general estimate is around 3-4 hours for a full Thanksgiving meal.\n\nNow, let's compare the two. If Hamilton is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, and the cooking time for Thanksgiving dinner is around 3-4 hours, it seems like watching Hamilton while the dinner cooks might be cutting it close.\n\nConsidering that Thanksgiving dinner requires attention and timing to ensure that all dishes are cooked properly and ready to be served at the same time, it might be best to choose a shorter form of entertainment or divide the cooking and watching time into separate chunks.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the runtime of Hamilton and the typical cooking time for Thanksgiving dinner, it might be best to find a shorter form of entertainment or to watch Hamilton in separate chunks to ensure that the meal is prepared properly and on time."
