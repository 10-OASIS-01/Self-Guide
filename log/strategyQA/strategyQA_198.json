This tradition comes from the belief that wearing green makes a person invisible to leprechauns, who would otherwise pinch anyone they could see. \n\nNow, let's apply this tradition to the Hulk. The Hulk is a fictional character known for his green skin. Since he is already green, it would not make sense for people to pinch him on St. Patrick's Day, as he would already be \"wearing\" green.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, it is unlikely that people would pinch the Hulk on St. Patrick's Day, as he is already \"wearing\" green and would be invisible to leprechauns according to the tradition."

The tradition of wearing green to avoid being pinched directly applies to the Hulk, as he is already green. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that people would not pinch the Hulk on St. Patrick's Day."
