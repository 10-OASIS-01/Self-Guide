            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the Taego and Jogye orders of bhikkhu in the context of their beliefs and practices. \n\nThe Taego and Jogye orders are two of the largest sects of Korean Buddhism. Both orders follow the Vinaya, which is a set of rules and guidelines for monastic conduct, including rules regarding sexual activity.\n\nIn general, both orders emphasize celibacy and the renunciation of worldly desires, including sexual activity. However, it's important to note that individual adherence to these principles can vary among monks in both orders.\n\nTo determine if Taego order bhikkhu are generally less sexually active than Jogye order ones, we would need to consider several factors:\n\n1. The teachings and interpretations of the Vinaya within each order: It's important to understand how each order interprets and applies the rules regarding celibacy and sexual activity. This can vary based on the specific teachings and traditions of each order.\n\n2. The cultural and societal influences on individual monks: Cultural and societal factors can also play a role in the behavior of individual monks. For example, the attitudes towards celibacy and sexual activity within the broader Korean society may influence the behavior of monks in each order.\n\n3. The individual commitment and discipline of monks: Ultimately, the sexual activity of individual monks may depend on their personal commitment to celibacy and their discipline in following the guidelines of their order.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's not accurate to make a blanket statement about the sexual activity of Taego order bhikkhu compared to Jogye order ones. Instead, it would require a more nuanced understanding of the teachings, practices, and individual behaviors within each order to make a meaningful comparison."
