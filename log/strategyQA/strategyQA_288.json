The decomposition provides a structured breakdown of the key elements, while the additional analysis emphasizes the need to consider the nature of both properties and look for specific evidence within Futurama. The final inference is based on the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim and the unlikely crossover between the two unrelated properties. Therefore, the answer is false."
