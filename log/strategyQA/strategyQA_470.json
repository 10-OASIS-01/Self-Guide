However, there is no direct connection between Donald Duck's birthday and the \"Friday the 13th\" series.\n\nAnother possibility could be the \"Halloween\" horror film series, as Halloween is a popular holiday associated with horror and spooky themes. However, there is no direct connection between Donald Duck's birthday and the \"Halloween\" series either.\n\nUpon further analysis, it becomes clear that there is no known association between Donald Duck's birthday and any specific horror series. The two seem to be unrelated.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing and reasoning through the problem, it can be determined that Donald Duck's birthday is not associated with any horror series.
