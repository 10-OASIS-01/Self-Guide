It is located in the Ionian Sea, off the northeast coast of Kefalonia and to the west of continental Greece.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the question - whether there is a town in New York with the same name as the hero's hometown. Ithaca, New York is a city located in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. It is home to Cornell University and Ithaca College.\n\nBased on this information, it is clear that the hero of the Odyssey does not come from a town that is also found in New York. The town of Ithaca in the Odyssey is in Greece, while the town of Ithaca in New York is in the United States. Therefore, there is no connection between the two locations."
