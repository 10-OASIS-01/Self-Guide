So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\n\nThe US drinking age is 21, so we need to check if 21 is a Fibonacci number. To do this, we can start by checking if 21 is in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nWe can see that 21 is not directly in the sequence, but we can calculate the Fibonacci numbers until we reach or exceed 21. \n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21\n\nSo, 21 is the 8th number in the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nTherefore, the US drinking age of 21 is indeed a Fibonacci number. \n\nIn conclusion, the US drinking age is a Fibonacci number, as it is the 8th number in the Fibonacci sequence."
