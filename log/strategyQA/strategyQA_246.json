According to the Bible, Noah was instructed by God to bring two of every kind of animal onto the ark to save them from the flood.\n\nNow, let's consider the capybara. Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world and are native to South America. It is unlikely that capybaras would have been present in the region where Noah lived and built the ark.\n\nAdditionally, the Bible specifically mentions that Noah was to bring two of every kind of animal onto the ark. Since capybaras are a single species, it would only be necessary to bring two capybaras onto the ark, not two pairs.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from the Bible and the natural habitat of capybaras, it is unlikely that Noah brought two capybaras onto his ark."
