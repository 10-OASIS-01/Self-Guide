Therefore, it is not possible for the Spurs to win the NHL as they are not a hockey team.\n\nThe NHL is won by the team that performs the best in the playoffs, ultimately winning the Stanley Cup. The Spurs, as a basketball team, do not compete in the NHL and therefore cannot win it.\n\nIn order for a team to win the NHL, they must be a part of the league and compete in the sport of ice hockey.
