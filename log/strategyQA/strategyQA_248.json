In a non-leap year, February has 28 days, and in a leap year, it has 29 days. \n\nNext, we need to determine the day of the week on which February 1st falls in the given year. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as using a perpetual calendar or a computer program. \n\nOnce we know the day of the week for February 1st, we can then determine the day of the week for the remaining days in February. \n\nIf February 1st falls on a Sunday, then there will be four Sundays in February in a non-leap year and five Sundays in February in a leap year. \n\nIf February 1st falls on a Monday, then there will be four Sundays in February in a leap year and five Sundays in February in a non-leap year. \n\nBy following this reasoning process, we can determine whether February has no Sundays or not based on the specific year in question."

Therefore, it is not possible for February to have no Sunday. This reasoning process provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to solving the problem and arriving at the correct conclusion."
