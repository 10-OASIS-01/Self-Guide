According to the Guinness World Records, the largest cheeseburger weighed 2,014 pounds (914 kg). This is an incredibly large and heavy cheeseburger.\n\nNext, let's consider the strength of an adult elephant. An adult African elephant can weigh between 5,000 to 14,000 pounds (2,268 to 6,350 kg), and they are known for their incredible strength. They can lift and carry heavy objects with their trunk and tusks.\n\nGiven the size and weight of the largest cheeseburger and the strength of an adult elephant, it is reasonable to conclude that an adult elephant would be able to lift the biggest cheeseburger ever made. However, it would likely require significant effort and may not be a practical or natural task for the elephant.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the size and weight of the cheeseburger and the strength of an adult elephant, it is theoretically possible for an adult elephant to lift the biggest cheeseburger ever made, but it may not be a realistic or practical scenario."
