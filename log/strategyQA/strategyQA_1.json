The most well-known members are Queen Elizabeth II, her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. \n\nAs of now, there is no direct American in the British royal family. However, Meghan Markle, who is American, married Prince Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II. This makes Meghan Markle a member of the royal family by marriage, but not by birth. \n\nSo, while there is an American who is part of the extended royal family, there is no direct American born into the British royal family. \n\nIn conclusion, the British royal family does have an American in it, but not as a direct descendant."
