            "content": "First, let's break down the question and identify the key components. The bird on the crest of the University of the West Indies is likely a representation of a specific bird species. The University of the West Indies is located in the Caribbean, so the bird on its crest is likely a species native to that region. \n\nOn the other hand, whitebait is a term used in New Zealand to describe the juvenile forms of several species of fish. These fish are typically found in rivers and streams, and are an important part of New Zealand's culinary culture.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that the bird on the crest of the University of the West Indies would feed on whitebait in New Zealand. The bird on the crest is likely a species native to the Caribbean, and would therefore not be found in New Zealand. Additionally, even if the bird were present in New Zealand, it is unlikely that it would feed on whitebait, as the diet of birds is typically specific to their natural habitat and available food sources.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the geographical location and natural habitats of the bird on the crest of the University of the West Indies and the whitebait in New Zealand, it is unlikely that the bird would feed on whitebait in New Zealand."
