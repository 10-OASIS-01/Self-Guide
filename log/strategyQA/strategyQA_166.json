Rastafarianism is a religion that originated in Jamaica and is based on the teachings of Marcus Garvey and the belief in the divinity of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that Bob Marley was an atheist. Rastafarianism is a faith-based religion that believes in a higher power, and Bob Marley was known for incorporating Rastafarian beliefs and themes into his music.\n\nAdditionally, in interviews and his own writings, Bob Marley often spoke about his spiritual beliefs and the influence of Rastafarianism on his music and life. This further supports the idea that he was not an atheist.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence of Bob Marley's religious beliefs and the influence of Rastafarianism in his life and music, it is unlikely that he was an atheist."
