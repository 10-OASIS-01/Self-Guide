Edgar Hoover was eligible for public school at the turn of the century, we need to consider his birth year and the laws and regulations regarding public school eligibility at that time.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover was born on January 1, 1895. This means that the turn of the century, in this context, refers to the early 1900s.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, public school eligibility in the United States was often determined by age and residency. Most states had compulsory education laws in place, requiring children to attend school for a certain number of years. However, these laws varied by state and sometimes by local jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that J. Edgar Hoover was born in 1895, he would have been of school age in the early 1900s. Therefore, he would have been eligible for public school based on his age.\n\nAdditionally, Hoover was born in Washington, D.C., which had its own public school system. As a resident of the city, he would have been eligible to attend public school there.\n\nIn conclusion, based on his age and residency, J. Edgar Hoover would have been eligible for public school at the turn of the century."
