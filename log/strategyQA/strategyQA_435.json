It is not known for its structural or adhesive properties.\n\nNext, let's consider the materials commonly used in construction of houses. These materials include wood, concrete, steel, bricks, and various types of adhesives and sealants.\n\nBased on this information, it is unlikely that garlic is used in the construction of houses. There is no evidence or common knowledge to suggest that garlic has any structural or adhesive properties that would make it useful in construction.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the properties of garlic and the materials commonly used in construction, it is reasonable to say that garlic is not used in the construction of houses."
