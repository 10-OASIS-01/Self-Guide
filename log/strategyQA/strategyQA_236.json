I would look for reliable sources such as historical documents, official websites, or reputable books on the subject.\n\nIf I find that the East India Company's coat of arms does indeed include the symbol of St. George, I would then consider the significance of this symbol. St. George is a well-known figure in English history and is often associated with bravery and chivalry. The presence of his symbol on the coat of arms could indicate a connection to these values.\n\nOn the other hand, if I find that the East India Company's coat of arms does not include the symbol of St. George, I would consider the reasons for its absence. It could be that the company chose to use different symbols that were more relevant to its own history and values.\n\nIn either case, I would also consider the historical context of the East India Company and the significance of its coat of arms. This could provide further insight into the reasons behind the presence or absence of the St. George symbol.\n\nOverall, my approach to solving this problem would involve thorough research, critical thinking, and consideration of historical context in order to arrive at a well-reasoned conclusion."
